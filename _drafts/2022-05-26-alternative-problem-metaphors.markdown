I've been thinking about ways we use metaphor when talking about (new) technologies for a bit. Choosing the metaphor with which we describe a new technology does real work: it can help kick-start understanding, but its price is limiting how we conceptualize the technology and thus close-off our minds to possibilities we might have considered had a different metaphor been chosen.

Here's a nice example of this from [a Medium post by Alan Cooper](https://mralancooper.medium.com/the-myth-of-metaphor-de16bfa1cbbe): 

> The most insidious problem with metaphors, the showstopper, comes from tying our interfaces to mechanical age artifacts. It is easy to intuit how to use the clipboard, for example, because it is a metaphor. But to adhere to the clipboard metaphor, the facility is incredibly weak. It won’t hold more than one thing, it doesn’t have a memory of what it held before, it can’t identify where the images came from, it can’t show you thumbnails of what it holds and it doesn’t save its contents from run to run. All of these actions are non-metaphoric and would have to be learned. Following the metaphor gives users a momentary boost the first time they use the clipboard but it costs them greatly ever after in the arbitrary weakness of the facility.

As he writes earlier in the post:

> Metaphors offer a tiny boost in learnability to first time users at tremendous cost. The biggest problem is that by representing old technology, metaphors firmly nail our conceptual feet to the ground, forever limiting the power of our software. 

So yeah, using metaphors can be limiting. But it seems like we're stuck with them for now.

Recently, I finally got to a book that had been on my shelf for a while: [_Metaphors We Live By_ by Mark Johnson and George Lakoff](https://bookshop.org/books/metaphors-we-live-by/9780226468013). It was first published in 1980, but, phew, it still feels radical to me.

That said, I think we're still stuck with metaphors. 
You ever have a new idea come at you from two independent sources within a short timespan and think of it as a sign?

> Grothendieck spoke of problem-solving as akin to opening a hard nut. You could open it with sharp tools and a hammer, but that was not his way. He said that it was better to put the nut in liquid, to let it soak, even to walk away from it, until eventually it opened. 

> He also spoke of “the rising sea.” One way to think of this: there’s a rocky and difficult shore, which you must somehow get your boat across. There may be a variety of ingenious engineering feats that can respond to this challenge. But another solution is to wait for the sea to rise, providing a smooth surface to cross effortlessly. The mathematician and writer Jordan Ellenberg said of his first encounters with Grothendieck’s work on schemes, “Once you see it set up this way, it doesn’t read like a style or trend. It feels inevitable, like: This is what it is.”
