The beginning of December (2018) marks a full year since put my beloved MacBook Air aside and started using a laptop running Linux.

In January of 2018, about a month after the switch, I wrote [a very long blog post](https://sts10.github.io/2018/01/06/switching-to-linux.html) about why I chose to ditch Mac, some thoughts about free software, and (eventually) the laptop I bought (an Oryx Pro, made by System76).

Eleven months later, my comfort using Linux has grown a bit, and I'd like to think I have a better understanding of who the operating system would work best for in 2019 and beyond.

## What It's Like to Use Linux Day In and Day Out

### The Basics

When I first started researching Linux around the fall of 2016, I wasn't even sure if there were icons you could click with a mouse (I guess I just imagined a white-on-black command line prompt). Undaunted, I first made a list of things that I would absolutely need to do on Linux if I were to use it at home. In short, at least at first, **I was focused on making sure I wouldn't _lose_ any abilities by switching to Linux**.

Have you ever stopped and thought about what you do on your personal computer these days? For me, both in 2016 and now, I mostly: listen to Spotify, write notes/documents and compile code, and use a password manager. I may be a bit of an anomaly in that I don't do a lot of media editing at home: I might occasionally edit RAW photos and maybe make a GIF now and then.

_Everything else_ that I do on my personal computer happens in a web browser. Watching Netflix/Hulu/etc, browse the internet generally, read Twitter, send instant messages/Slack, write emails... for me, all of that is (or at least can be) done in a web browser. Even things like creating a resume or editing a photo can be done with services like Google Docs and Pixlr. Heck, most of my job happens in Chrome.

So did I lose the ability to do any specific things that I did on my mac? Sure. The absence of iMessage on desktop and, sure, Adobe Light Room stand out. But, in large part, since (a) Chrome works mostly the same as it does on Mac (with some exceptions involving Flash), and (b) I can run Spotify, compile code, and manage passwords, I can do most of what I did with MacOS on Linux too. Right now I'm writing this sentence in a terminal window running Neovim on one monitor, a Chrome window with 10 tabs open on my external monitor, and listening to Spotify in the background, just like a normal, MacBook-using Millennial. I'm just doing it on Linux, something that (delightfully) I forget pretty often.

Really, Linux is the bits outside of your browser and Spotify. It's the menus and widgets and settings. Utilites like RedShift, 

### The Good (What Did I Gain From Switching to Linux?)

So what did I gain from switching? I spent more than $2,000 on my Linux laptop, so I definitely didn't save a lot of money (though I could have if I wanted to make some sacrifices).

Overall, I've found the joys of using Linux are subtle, but powerful.

**Choice, Flexibility, and Customizability**: As I noted a year ago, Linux comes in different versions, known as distributions (examples include Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, Manjaro, Arch, etc.). Additionally, most of these distributions can use a variety of different desktop environments (e.g. Gnome, KDE, Xfce, etc.). A desktop environment is the part of the operating system that the user interacts with most – it includes the file manager, the menus like wifi, date and time, etc., some the default applications, notifications, all that stuff. 

If you've only used Mac, you've (arguably) only used iterative versions of not only the same "distribution" but also the same desktop environment (called [Aqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(user_interface/))).

With Linux, if you don't like something, you can either change it find something different. I can't stress the joy and power of this enough. Linux has its problems, but I'm much more free from any one corporation's choices about how I should be using my computer.

(distros, packagage management, DE, apps, etc.)

**Disposability**: 

**Gets out of the way**

**The Software is the Product, and it's built for users like you**: Bluntly put, with Linux, you are not the product. The kernel, the distribution, the desktop environment, the themes, the applications... for the developers and designers who contribute to open source project, those are the products. And when they work on these products, thanks to the philosophy and economic nature of free and open source software, as well as the modern [legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) and [technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) infrastructure in place, they are free of economic imperatives of proprietary software like charging for installations and updates, preventing piracy, guarding innovative secrets, suing competitors, or even delivering newsworthy updates all one release. There are almost never shareholders or boards with opinions to take into account.

Even if you don't write code, good open source software has a public  conversation surrounding it -- usually on services like GitHub, GitLab, IRC, Matrix, or Reddit -- that you can read and, if you like, participate in. When you read these debates, bug reports, feature requests, requests/pleas for help, you usually get a sense that the developers are users just like you, who want the product to be the best it can. You are, in that sense on the same team. Your goals are aligned.

As one hacker told Gabriella Coleman, as quoted in [_Coding Freedom_](https://gabriellacoleman.org/Coleman-Coding-Freedom.pdf): 

> The important difference for me is whether I come away feeling that I have created something of lasting intrinsic value or not… [most] often when I am done with corporate software, it’s dead, and when I am done with free software, it is alive.


### The Bad

The ethic of Linux users has to be one of humility and an assumption of "buyer be ware." From what I've gathered from people like [Bryan Lunduke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVHcdgrqbHE), up until just a few years ago, Linux was hard to use. WiFi would stop working after running (seemingly unrelated) updates, sound wouldn't work right, programs were hard to install and were worse in general than they are now, etc. 

Things are better now, but I encountered plenty of hiccups that my experience as a general MacOS user did not prepare me for well. For example,


### My Phone

I've also found that, given that I can do so much on my iPhone (email, text/IM/Slack, browse the web, read books and articles, look up directions, take notes, book flights), I don't _need_ my computer to be always available, or even able to do all the things my phone can do.

## An Attempt at a Brief, Practical Review of the Oryx Pro

Notes


Can do a lot on phone, which frees your laptop to be a little less reliable. Work Mac helped too. 

Kubuntu is almost the right distro

In each way that MacOS has become more like a toy and less like a tool (for developers at least), Linux can be configured as a tool. 

Linux gets out of my way and stays out of my way. 

Only more reasons, in last 12 months, not to buy another Macbook https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw9qk7/macbook-pro-software-locks-prevent-independent-repair 

What about the new Air? Still has that butterfly keyboard and only one port when charging. 

"What laptop should I get?" is still an open question https://twitter.com/jbenton/status/1061984229465165824 (He went with a new Air https://twitter.com/jbenton/status/1062773545728643077)

Prompts to update are still annoying https://medium.com/s/thenewnew/why-we-dread-new-software-updates-54abc5b62bb1

Mention the Pinebook and/or Nate's early Chrome book experience. Who would want a Pinebook instead of a Chromebook?

In November of 2016, I was already eyeing a move (https://twitter.com/sts10/status/803771633139908610). Almost exactly one year later, I finally pulled the trigger.
