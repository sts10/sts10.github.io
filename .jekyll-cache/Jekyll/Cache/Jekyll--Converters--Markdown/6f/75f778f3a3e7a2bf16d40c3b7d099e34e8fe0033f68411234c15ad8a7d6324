I"ù<p>Iâ€™ve been playing with my color theme and default font-face in my code editor, Sublime Text 2, this cold, snowy weekend, so I thought Iâ€™d share a little about my current application setup. I donâ€™t know, maybe this is boring? Self-involved? I try not to get too bogged down in tricking out my gear (while I should be writing code). But on the other hand, now that Iâ€™m using my computer even more than I have in the past, I do think itâ€™s important to get it feeling right and looking good.</p>
