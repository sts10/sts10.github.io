I"T<p>Every June my family has a big reunion down south. One of our traditions is playing a card game called Contract Rummy. If you don’t know the game here is <a href="http://www.pagat.com/rummy/ctrummy.html">one version of rules</a>, but basically it’s gin rummy with 5 pre-set hands everyone plays. In the first hand, the “contract”– what every player is trying to “get”– is 2 sets of 3, or 2 3’s-of-a-kind. For example, three 6s and three Jacks would fulfill this contract. The second hand is a set of 3 and a run of 4 (6 7 8 9, for example. Must be all in the same suit).</p>
