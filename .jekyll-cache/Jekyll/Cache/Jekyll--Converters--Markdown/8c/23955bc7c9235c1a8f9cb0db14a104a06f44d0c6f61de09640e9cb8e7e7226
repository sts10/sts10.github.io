I"L<p>Phew! My brain has been hurting (in a good way) for the first time in years. Looking back over the last 7 days, I’d say I spent at least 14 hours a day dealing with code. The best metaphor I can think of is that part in the Matrix when they plug Keanu Reeves in so he can learn things quickly. That’s what it feels like.</p>
