I"„<p>At work I was working with <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>, a JavaScript charting library. The specific file I was working in had a number of these charts defined in it, each of which had a good amount of settings and functions within them. As a result, in spite of other vim awesomeness, I found that I was having some trouble navigating around the long file.</p>
