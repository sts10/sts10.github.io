I"˛z<p>Ahead of this year‚Äôs World Password Day, 1Password ‚Äì maker of password management software ‚Äì announced <a href="https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/04/26/how-strong-should-your-master-password-be-for-world-password-day-wed-like-to-know/">a password cracking challenge</a>. The company ostensibly wanted to find out how hard it would be to crack a three-word passphrase master password on one of their vaults, assuming that the attacker had the derived hash of the passphrase.</p>

<p>(As of the evening of May 31st, <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/onepasswordgame">none of the passwords have been cracked</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="wait-what">Wait, What?</h2>

<p>First of all, the 1Password <a href="https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/04/26/how-strong-should-your-master-password-be-for-world-password-day-wed-like-to-know/">blog post</a> announcing the challenge does a pretty good job at explaining what the challenge is all about in a pretty non-technical way. But we can step back for a minute and ask ‚Äúhow are passwords stored?‚Äù For example, how does Amazon (or 1Password) store my password?</p>

<p>They are NOT just stored in plain text. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtInClXe1Q">This video</a> does a good job of explaining why, but basically it‚Äôs because if someone gets their hands on that database, they‚Äôll have every user‚Äôs username and password right there.</p>

<p>Vaguely, generally, from a non-expert, the best way to store passwords (as a website) is to <em>hash</em> and <em>salt</em> the passwords. To hand-wave over that, let‚Äôs stick to ‚Äúhashing‚Äù. Hashing, I‚Äôve only recently learned, basically means you run the password through a one-way mathematical function, and then only store the result. Wikipedia defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function">one-way mathematical function</a> thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input. Here, ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and ‚Äúhard‚Äù are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems. Not being one-to-one is not considered sufficient of a function for it to be called one-way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of a (apparently useful) one-way function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function#Multiplication_and_factoring">multiplying two very large prime numbers</a>. Multiplying two numbers isn‚Äôt hard to do computationally (even if they‚Äôre huge numbers), but if I gave you a huge number and said ‚Äúguess the two prime numbers that I multiplied together to make this number‚Äù you‚Äôd be forced to do a lot of guessing and checking, by multiplication, to get the answer.</p>

<h2 id="a-non-mathematical-metaphor-for-my-fellow-liberal-arts-grads">A Non-Mathematical Metaphor For My Fellow Liberal Arts Grads</h2>

<p>One non-mathematical example that helped me get a handle on this is mixing paint colors: it‚Äôs easy to mix red and blue paint and get purple, but it‚Äôs very hard to take purple and somehow get the exact shades of red and blue back. Even if you had the purple and the blue it‚Äôd be hard to get the red back without a lot of trial and error. But if you had the blue and the purple and someone asked you to check a given shade of red, it‚Äôd be easy to check it (just mix the red with your blue and see if it‚Äôs the same as the purple you have).</p>

<p>Specifics aside, the general idea is that we‚Äôre going to pass some parameters (information) into a function and we‚Äôre going to get an output that we can reliably compare to a stored output. Amazon, Facebook, and 1Password all store your exact shade of purple (though you‚Äôre hopefully using different passwords for each service). You type in your password (a specific shade of red), the website or program does the mixing (the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù direction of the one-way function) with a standardized shade of blue and then compares the produced (or ‚Äúderived‚Äù) shade of purple with the shade it has on file. If they match, you‚Äôre in; if they don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre rejected.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs basically a game of Go Fish ‚Äì exactly what you‚Äôd want to protect a password.</p>

<p>To translate some of the terms I‚Äôll be using going forward: the shade of red‚Äì the password ‚Äì is the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù; the method by which we‚Äôll mix the colors is called the digest algorithm; the shade of purple (correct or incorrect) is called the ‚Äúderived hash‚Äù. We‚Äôll have some other variables as well that don‚Äôt fit the metaphor too well ‚Äì for example, the ‚Äúsalt‚Äù could be defined as the shade of blue we‚Äôre using to mix (it can be known to the attack and indeed is in the 1Password challenge), and the number of iterations could be thought of as how <em>much</em> paint we‚Äôre dealing with in total: the more paint the longer it takes a given computer to ‚Äúmix‚Äù the colors, slowing down a brute force attack.</p>

<p>The one-way function that 1Password actually uses to hash its master passwords is Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PDKF2</a>). More on this below, but let‚Äôs look at the text of the actual challenge for a second.</p>

<h2 id="how-1passwords-challenge-works">How 1Password‚Äôs Challenge Works</h2>

<p>Right when the challenge started, a 1Password employee pushed the actual challenges to <a href="https://github.com/agilebits/crackme">this Github repo</a>. <a href="https://github.com/agilebits/crackme/blob/master/password-day-2018.json">Here‚Äôs the json file</a>, which has three samples and then seven actual challenges. Let me just be super clear here: neither the samples nor that challenges are actual passwords of users! This is all for research purposes. Don‚Äôt use my program to crack actual hashes of real user passwords!</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the first sample (think of it as for practice):</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

<p>Since this is a sample, they give us the password here (in this case, ‚Äúgovernor washout beak‚Äù). We also get the algorithm name, the number of rounds, the salt, and the derived hash. This is useful for making sure our cracker is working correctly.</p>

<p>The entries a bit further down in that file are the actual challenges, and they are the same as the samples except they don‚Äôt give the password (that‚Äôs for us to find out!). Here‚Äôs the first one.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wrote">What I Wrote</h2>

<p>Now I‚Äôm pretty sure that the tool you‚Äôre <em>supposed</em> to use for something like this is <a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/">hashcat</a> or <a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a> ‚Äì here‚Äôs <a href="https://twitter.com/netmux/status/992086115459977217">one user‚Äôs screenshot of hashcat or something similar</a>. But I‚Äôve been slowly teaching myself a programming language called Rust, and I wanted to learn more about password hashing (plus, with only access to my personal laptop, I felt I didn‚Äôt really have a chance of winning the challenge no matter the method I used). Note: during almost every step of the way outlined below I got some help from Fediverse users (if any of y‚Äôall want a shout-out here, let me know, though I assumed you wouldn‚Äôt).</p>

<p>For the eager, here‚Äôs my Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/sts10/crackme-rust/tree/master">the master branch</a> uses Rayon to use threading, while <a href="https://github.com/sts10/crackme-rust/tree/no-threads">the ‚Äúno-threads‚Äù branch</a> does not (it‚Äôs easier to read my crappy Rust without my implementation of threading).</p>

<h3 id="pdkdf2-from-the-ring-crate">PDKDF2 from the Ring crate</h3>

<p>I found a Rust ‚Äúcrate‚Äù or library called <a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">Ring</a> that has <a href="https://briansmith.org/rustdoc/ring/pbkdf2/index.html">a pdkdf2 function already defined</a> (it‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/b73e2a248b9239d86f45711238499189d256fe29/src/pbkdf2.rs#L142">defined here</a>). It takes five variables as inputs: algorithm type, number of iterations, the ‚Äúsalt‚Äù, the secret (aka our password guess), and the output variable you want to store the derived hash in.</p>

<p>To actually use Ring‚Äôs pdkdf2 function to attack the 1Password challenge format, I found that I needed to write a wrapper function that did some basic text formatting before and after actually calling the function from the Ring crate. Here is that wrapper function, plus some global variables I grabbed from <a href="https://briansmith.org/rustdoc/ring/pbkdf2/index.html#password-database-example">the example the Ring library gave</a>:</p>

<p>Getting the salt formatted correctly took a bit of trial and error and frustration. Likewise, as you can see, after calling the library‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">derive</code> function I had to give some zero-padding to each byte of the derived hash, as well as make it lowercase, before I could compare it to the derived hashes that 1Password presents in its challenge.</p>

<p>I wrote a few tests of this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">derive</code> function. Here‚Äôs one of those tests:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">#[test]</span>
<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">derive_example1</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">salt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"00bb202b205f064e30f6fae101162a2e"</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">derived</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"91976be95cd28e55e580ee9f69a2139202a9b65eabfbbf33c99bc42e3665564d"</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nd">assert_eq!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">derive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">salt</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">password</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">derived</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It basically says: given a number of rounds, a salt, and a password, will the resulting derived hash be equal to the one 1Password gives in one of their samples (here‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/agilebits/crackme/blob/master/doc/answers-2018-03-30.json#L2">the sample</a>)? In other words, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">derive(100000, salt, password)</code> should equal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"91976be95cd28e55e580ee9f69a2139202a9b65eabfbbf33c99bc42e3665564d"</code>. And when we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cargo test</code> Cargo informs us that it passes this test.</p>

<p>Now we‚Äôre ready to look at the shorter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guess</code> function. This function takes our guess, the number of iterations, the salt, and the derived hashed that we want to compare our output to. If they match, it returns the boolean True. If they don‚Äôt match, it returns False.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">guess</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">password_guess</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">iterations</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">u32</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">salt</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">derived</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">bool</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Guessing {}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">password_guess</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nf">derive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">iterations</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">salt</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">password_guess</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">derived</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Obviously we‚Äôre going to be running this guess function a lot (we are going to be mixing a lot of shades of red and comparing the outputted shade of purple with the given shade of purple).</p>

<p>And we want to make sure that when it does test the correct password, that it really returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> (otherwise we‚Äôd blow right by the correct password). So here‚Äôs how I tested this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guess</code> function:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">#[test]</span>

<h3 id="the-guessing-loops">The guessing loops</h3>

<p>1Password tells us that the passwords will be three words <a href="https://github.com/agilebits/crackme/tree/master/cmd">RANDOMLY chosen</a> from <a href="https://github.com/agilebits/crackme/blob/master/doc/AgileWords.txt">this word list</a>, with a space in between each word. (To understand why it‚Äôs important to have a character in between each word, you can read <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2018/05/05/compound-passphrase-list-safety-checker.html">an earlier post of mine</a>.)</p>

<p>We want to run through every possible password (since their made up of three words we could also call them passphrases), performing what‚Äôs called a brute force attack. For example, our first guess is going to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aardvark aardvark aardvark</code>, and then our second guess will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aardvark aardvark abaci</code>, and so on, until our produced derived hash matches the given derived hash.</p>

<p>Here is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_crack</code> function (as seen in <a href="https://github.com/sts10/crackme-rust/blob/no-threads/src/main.rs">the ‚Äúno-threads‚Äù branch of the Github repo</a>). It sports three nested <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loops, each of which work through the same array of words created from the word list text file. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guess</code> function (shown above) returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, it prints the correct guess and then returns it; else it prints the incorrect guess and moves on to the next guess.</p>

<p>At this point you may be wondering how many different passphrases are possible given 1Password‚Äôs stated rules. The number of words on the word list is 18,328, so the number of possible passphrases is 18,328 * 18,328 * 18,328 ‚Äì roughly 6,156,000,000,000, or over 6 trillion.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-long">So‚Ä¶ How long?</h2>

<p>So how long would it take my System76 Oryx Pro with a not-too-shabby Intel i7-7700HQ? As a test I set the mystery password as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aardvark aardvark accolade</code>, the 100th passphrase that my program would guess. <a href="https://github.com/sts10/crackme-rust/blob/no-threads/src/main.rs#L90">My janky benchmark function</a> tells me that my laptop does those 100 guesses in about 4,167 milliseconds, which works out to about 24 guess per second. Considering there are literally trillions of possible passphrases, this is‚Ä¶ comically much, much too slow. If we extrapolate, it would take 8,193 years to check all of the passphrases (using one core).</p>

<p>We can speed up the cracking by telling Rust to use all eight <em>threads</em> that my laptop has in parallel. I did this using <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">the Rayon crate</a> ‚Äì you can see <a href="https://github.com/sts10/crackme-rust/blob/master/src/main.rs#L34">that version of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run crack</code> function here</a>, but it is a bit messier than the above version, and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get it to stop running when it found the correct password.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">well, I&#39;m putting the 8 cores to use at least <a href="https://t.co/R12GV0FNIZ">pic.twitter.com/R12GV0FNIZ</a></p>&mdash; Sam Schlinkert (@sts10) <a href="https://twitter.com/sts10/status/992247500160421888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>If I were to use all eight threads, and assume they‚Äôd all run as fast as when I running on just one core, that‚Äôs still over a thousand years. <em>Even if</em> the password we were looking for was square in the middle of the list, we‚Äôre still at five centuries!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm hoping that the code works slowly because my CPUs just aren‚Äôt powerful enough to run the 100,000 rounds of the PDKDF2 function that quickly (I think hashcat uses GPUs rather than CPUs), but it‚Äôs possible that my code could be more efficient. My goal was to get it working though.</p>

<p>Unfazed, I ran the finished script (using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cargo run --release</code>) for about 36 hours for the lulz, figuring I might get lucky. I didn‚Äôt trust my benchmark ‚Äì maybe it was guessing faster‚Äì, and as I fell asleep to the sounds of my laptop‚Äôs fan working at what was presumably its top speed, I fell asleep daring to dream about miraculously winning the $4,096 top prize, and the fame it would gain me, a mere social media producer who just started writing Rust. But of course, I was just mixing the wrong shades of paint very quickly, casting for fish in a very large sea.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-might-go-about-solving-this">How I Might Go About Solving This</h2>

<p>Without a single powerful computer, I think the only way to make progress on the trillions of guesses is to use multiple computers.</p>
