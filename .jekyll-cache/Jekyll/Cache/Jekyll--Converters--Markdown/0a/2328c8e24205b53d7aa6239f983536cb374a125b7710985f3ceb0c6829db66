I"Ì<p>On January 11th, the day after David Bowie died, The New York Public Library‚Äôs blog posted <a href="http://www.nypl.org/blog/2016/01/11/david-bowies-top-100-books?hspace=332034">a list of the musician‚Äôs 100 favorite books</a>, based off of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidbowie/?target_post=10151603205477665&amp;ref=story_permalink">a Facebook post on his verified page from 2013</a>. A friend sent me the NYPL link and I, delighted by the idea of a project, looked up each of them on Amazon.</p>

<p>There are some interesting trends‚Äì as you‚Äôd expect there‚Äôs a few histories of music (which I‚Äôm currently uninterested in), but also a handful about Black history and Russian history. I‚Äôd read a few of them (big thumbs-up for <em>Kafka Was the Rage</em>), and I had recently read other books by Bruce Chatwin and Michael Chabon, but most I‚Äôd never heard of.</p>

<p>I ended up ordering 16 (I think) of them, mostly the never-heard-ofs:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vnTfSeJ.jpg" alt="Amazon delivery" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Mr Norris Changes Trains</em></li>
  <li><em>Maldoror and the Complete Works of the Comte de Lautr√©amont</em></li>
  <li><em>The Leopard: A Novel</em></li>
  <li><em>Nights at the Circus</em></li>
  <li><em>Interviews with Francis Bacon (Subsequent)</em></li>
  <li><em>The Quest for Christa T.</em></li>
  <li><em>City of Night</em></li>
  <li><em>Passing (Penguin Classics)</em></li>
  <li><em>Money: A Suicide Note (Penguin Ink)</em></li>
  <li><em>The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea</em></li>
  <li><em>Zanoni</em></li>
  <li><em>The Trial of Henry Kissinger</em></li>
  <li><em>Last Exit to Brooklyn</em></li>
  <li><em>Infants of the Spring</em></li>
  <li><em>The 42nd Parallel: Volume One of the U.S.A. Trilogy</em></li>
  <li><em>Darkness at Noon</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôve now read three of them so far: <em>Zanoni</em> by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, <em>The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea</em> by Yukio Mishima, and most recently <em>Nights At The Circus</em> by Angela Carter. I didn‚Äôt like <em>The Sailor</em> and I didn‚Äôt even finished <em>Zanoni</em> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zanoni-Edward-Bulwer-Lytton-ebook/dp/B0084A7YGQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455465835&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=zanoni">it‚Äôs free on Kindle</a> by the way), but <em>Nights at the Circus</em> was a real treat.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a lot of color, performance, sadness, and female-ness in <em>Nights at the Circus</em>‚Äì ‚ÄúA luscious and gooey dessert of a book‚Ä¶ doled out in sinful proportions,‚Äù heralds <em>The Washington Post Book World</em>; ‚ÄúLoud, bawdy, and unabashedly sentimental,‚Äù wrote someone at the <em>Times</em>. I think those both seem pretty apt, especially the ‚Äúbawdy.‚Äù</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know much about Bowie, but I also think it‚Äôs pretty easy to see why this book was one of his favorites.  For each of these books, it‚Äôs fun to imagine where he read them, how he heard of them, what he took from them.</p>

<p>Now I get to choose which one to try next.</p>
