I"ù<p>I just realized that Iâ€™ve been using Vim for just about a year now (hereâ€™s <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2015/02/15/vim-update.html">one of my early posts on starting to make the switch</a>), so I figured itâ€™d be a good time to go over some of favorite parts of <a href="https://github.com/sts10/terminal_and_vim_settings/blob/master/vimrc">my vimrc</a>. Iâ€™m certainly no Vim expert, but if nothing else than recording my â€œprogress,â€ hereâ€™s a bit about how I use Vim at this point.</p>
