I"…<p>Iâ€™m excited about a community fork of <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> called <a href="https://keepassxc.org">KeePassXC</a>. They offer binary builds for the three major operating systems <a href="https://keepassxc.org/download">on their website</a>, however I wanted to build it from source for two reasons: (1) I was a little dubious of KeePassHTTP, which the developers are now building into the pre-built binaries (it appears to be disabled by default, but they have <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc#note-about-keepasshttp">a warning in the README</a>), and (2) I simply wanted the latest version, which already sports some UI improvements from the last time they made the binaries. Plus, to my knowledge, Iâ€™ve never built a real application from the source code before.</p>

<p>So, I headed over to <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc">their repo on GitHub</a> and got started. Hereâ€™s how I did it on OS X 10.10.5.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Set up build environment by following <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Set-up-Build-Environment-on-OS-X">these instructions</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clone down the current code from GitHub repo: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc.git</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the updated <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Building-KeePassXC#os-x">OS X build instructions</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I decided to disable two features of KeePassXC: Auto Type and KeePassHTTP, so in the line below I turned those flags <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OFF</code>. Also, I needed to find out what version of qt5 I had in order to put the correct version in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</code> flag below. To do this I navigated to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/Cellar/qt5</code> and looked at what the latest folder was there. In my case it was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5.8.0_1</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously you may need to edit the line below according to what flags you want and your version of qt5.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DWITH_XC_AUTOTYPE=OFF -DWITH_XC_HTTP=OFF -DWITH_XC_YUBIKEY=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.8.0_1/lib/cmake ..
make -j8 package
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above step, if completed successfully, will create a fresh DMG file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build</code> directory you created. Double click it to install KeePassXC (then drag it into your Applications folder).</p>

<p>My resulting debug info:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>KeePassXC - Version 2.1.3
Revision: b7546b45b3c48e2ffa150be72fc6ce03db1adf00

Libraries:
- Qt 5.8.0
- libgcrypt 1.7.6

Operating system: OS X Yosemite (10.10)
CPU architecture: x86_64
Kernel: darwin 14.5.0

Enabled extensions:
- YubiKey
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I tried pulling down the updated source code from GitHub and building the new version, but now, after I install the built DMG, I canâ€™t open KeePassXC. The error is a bit long and complexâ€¦ I might generate it again to post on here at some point.</p>

<p>I even tried to check out the 2.1.4 and then the 2.1.3 tags but I got the same error. Hopefully itâ€™s some glitch in the source codeâ€¦?</p>
