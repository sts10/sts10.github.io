I"ı<p>Midway through January, 2019, news broke of a large cache of emails and passwords, dubbed <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/">â€œCollection #1â€</a>, surfacing on the internet. Troy Hunt writes that it includes 772,904,991 unique email addresses and 21,222,975 unique passwords. Wow! Hunt cleaned and loaded the data into his service called HaveIBeenPwned, which allows (non-technical) users to enter either their <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">email</a> or <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">password(s)</a> to see if their data was included in the breach (or earlier breaches that heâ€™s cataloged). Huntâ€™s total list of passwords now includes more than half a billion unique passwords.</p>
