I"Ÿ<p>Over the summer of 2016 I started to pay a little more attention to my privacy and security on the internet and when using computers more generally. Some of this impetus had been slowly growing since the Snowden/NSA revelations and catching the documentary <em>Citizen 4</em>. More recently I read a few books about computer security, most notably <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Goliath-Battles-Collect-Control/dp/039335217X"><em>Data and Goliath</em> by Bruce Schneier</a>, and a few on open-source software and Linux: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary/dp/0596001088/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479008290&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cathedral+bazaar"><em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Freedom-Ethics-Aesthetics-Hacking/dp/0691144613/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479008327&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=coding+freedom"><em>Coding Freedom</em></a> (which <a href="https://twitter.com/sts10/status/778426748321005569">I admired for its liberal art sensibility</a>), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Other-Laws-Cyberspace-Version/dp/0465039146/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470604763&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lessig+code"><em>Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace</em> by Lessig</a>, the last of which I wrote <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/08/31/how-we-screw-it-up.html">a blog post</a> if youâ€™re interested.</p>
