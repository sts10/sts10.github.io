I"K<p>Last fall I was delighted to figure out <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2015/10/24/true-hex-colors-with-neovim-and-iterm2.html">how to get true HEX colors with Neovim and iTerm2</a>. However I have recently learned that you can have these same colors available in regular old terminal Vim (aka command line Vim) and iTerm2.</p>
