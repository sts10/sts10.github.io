I"Ï<p>Via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards">r/MechanicalKeyboards</a>, the mechanical keyboards subbreddit, I found this interesting interview with Eiiti Wada, the creator of the Happy Hacking Keyboard (which I love and use and have <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/an-update-to-my-keyboard-game/">written about before</a>). The interviewâ€™s introduction cites a previous interview with Wada where we apparently gave a quote that I think is just lovely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œBecause keyboards are accessories to PC makers, they focus on minimizing the manufacturing costs. But thatâ€™s incorrect. When Americaâ€™s cowboys were in the middle of a trip and their horse died, they would leave the horse there. But even if they were in the middle of a desert, they would take their saddle with them. The horse was a consumable good, but the saddle was an interface that their bodies had gotten used to. In the same vein, PCs are consumable goods, while keyboards are important interfaces.â€</p>

<p>Apparently there are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3zga1k/interview_professor_eiiti_wada_creator_of_the_hhkb/cyluhxx">â€œSaddleâ€ t-shirts</a>.</p>
