I"G<p>A couple of weeks ago I was <a href="https://twitter.com/sts10/status/839933857679949829">proud of myself for switching from RVM to rbenv</a>. The reason I made the switch was that I wanted something light-weight and I didnâ€™t like the RVM installation process, in particular the need to use the GPG command line tool.</p>
