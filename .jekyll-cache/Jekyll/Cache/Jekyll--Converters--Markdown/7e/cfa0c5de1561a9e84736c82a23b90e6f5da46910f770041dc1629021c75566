I"¥<p>Over the weekend Iâ€™ve been working a new side project in order to get more practice generating dynamic webpages using ERB. Iâ€™m calling it Recall and itâ€™s supposed to take a Ruby method as a user input from the command line and then dynamically generate a new webpage that displays every time youâ€™ve used that method, complete with the code line, the line number, and a link to the .rb file you used it in.</p>
