<p>I was jumping around Reddit earlier this month and stumbled upon <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>, a site created by <a href="http://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a> that has “small programming puzzles” for each day of the 25 days of Christmas. Like <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, they are presented in such a way that you can solve them any which way you please. And, having attempted six of them so far, I can say that the challenges are good for a variety of skill levels.</p>
