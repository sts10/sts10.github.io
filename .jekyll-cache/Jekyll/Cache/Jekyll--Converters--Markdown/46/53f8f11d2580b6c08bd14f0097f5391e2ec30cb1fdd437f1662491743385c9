I"<p>For the last year and a half I’ve been using both <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> and <a href="http://keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> to manage my passwords. I’ve been storing most usernames and passwords using 1Password, since I can easily access it on my iPhone and I have the Chrome extension installed at home, making signing in that much easier. I use 1Password with Dropbox by purchasing the <a href="https://agilebits.com/store">license</a> rather than pay a regular fee to 1Password (I took some <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2015/09/29/1password-setup.html">brief  notes</a> when I set it up in 2015). This means that my password database lives on my Dropbox account (though it’s still actually lives on somebody else’s computer).</p>
