I"<<p>I’ve been playing with my color theme and default font-face in my code editor, Sublime Text 2, this cold, snowy weekend, so I thought I’d share a little about my current application setup. I don’t know, maybe this is boring? Self-involved? I try not to get too bogged down in tricking out my gear (while I should be writing code). But on the other hand, now that I’m using my computer even more than I have in the past, I do think it’s important to get it feeling right and looking good.</p>

<p>This post will probably end up serving as an interesting sort of time capsule for me to see what I’m still using six months or a year from now. And hey, maybe one of you will find a new app or setting to use.</p>

<p>By no means is any of this set in stone— I even made some big changes this week, some of which may not last.</p>

<h3 id="main-applications">Main Applications</h3>

<p>For all my coding needs I’m still going strong with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>, which I started using while at The Daily Beast. I like to have a separate writing app, but Word is too slow. About a month ago I bought <a href="http://writer.pro/">Writer Pro</a> and I’ve stuck with it, writing and editing in Markdown for the first time. Sublime, Writer Pro, Chrome and the terminal really handle my day-to-day needs (plus Adium for gchat). For example I check my gmail in Chrome.</p>

<p>I’m trying to get into the habit of using command + tab to switch between programs and using <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> to open new applications (I think I’ll buy the PowerPack soon– Update: I have, but the free version is pretty great). Flatiron also recommended <a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a>, a free-to-try-forever app that let’s you search multiple coding language APIs offline. Haven’t used it much at this point, but glad it’s there if I’m ever need to look up a Ruby method or CSS selector on a beach without wifi someday.</p>

<h3 id="aesthetics">Aesthetics</h3>

<p>For Sublime Text 2 I’m now using <a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download">Deja Vu Sans Mono</a> at 16 px as my font. I also just switched to a new color theme called <a href="http://colorsublime.com/?page=9">Mustard</a>. Gotta say I’m pretty happy with the look—the masculine colors work well with the boldness of Deja Vu. I’ve got my tab width set to 2 and am indenting with spaces, which is apparently how the cool kids roll.</p>

<p>Also, in Sublime Text 2’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Preferences &gt; Settings - User</code> I switched “drag_text” to false, as I never use drag-and-drop to cut and paste text. I’d only do it sometimes by mistake, which really sucked. One less thing to worry about. Here’s my full User Settings file:</p>

<p>In my terminal, the customization of which <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2014/02/05/flatiron-day-two.html">I wrote about last week</a>, I’m sticking with <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/droid-sans-mono">Droid Sans Mono</a> size 13 px. I can’t find any other font that looks good with the terminal’s formatting.</p>

<h3 id="less-frequently-used-applications">Less-Frequently Used Applications</h3>

<p>I use <a href="http://cyberduck.io/">CyberDuck</a> for uploading to my personal site (although it’s been a little glitchy for me recently). <a href="http://xscopeapp.com/">xScope</a> is a nice little measurement app that helps for front-end web stuff (I’m currently rocking the free version).</p>

<p>I’m not super happy with <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html">Jing</a>, my screenshot handler. On Avi’s recommendation I’m considering trying <a href="http://glui.me/">Glui</a>.  For editing my own photos, I shelled out some bills for Adobe Lightroom to escape the grasp of iPhoto.</p>
