I"0<p>When I first installed <a href="https://ricochet.im/">Ricochet IM</a> on my machine running Lubuntu, I either ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install ricochet-im</code>, or downloaded it through Ubuntu’s GUI “Software” application. Regardless of which I chose, I think both methods install Ricochet version 1.1.2, as opposed the to latest release: <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/releases/tag/v1.1.4">1.1.4</a>. Considering this is a secure instant messaging app and new versions may contain important security fixes, I wanted to be using the latest version available (which I’m actually thanked in, due to <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/commit/fe40045cec8bed9a735c3cecbcca6ae2276d9902">some extremely minor documentation fixes</a>).</p>
