I"§<p>Since 2012-ish Iâ€™ve been using Sublime Text 2 as my primary text editor. Itâ€™s very simple out of the box, but also allows for a fair amount of customization through its packages, settings, snippets, and custom keybindings. Iâ€™ve written about <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2014/03/01/some-sublime-text-tips-and-tricks.html">how I use Sublime Text</a> before, and I still think itâ€™s a super powerful editor.</p>
