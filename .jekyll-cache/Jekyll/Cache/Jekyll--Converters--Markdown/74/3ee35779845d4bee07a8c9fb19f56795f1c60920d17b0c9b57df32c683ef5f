I"≥L<p>As 2019 approaches, I thought I‚Äôd write a new, updated version of <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/11/13/some-privacy-and-security-measures.html">my casual security guide from 2016</a>. Same disclaimers apply: I am still not an expert. I‚Äôm writing this mostly to have something to send to friends and family who ask me questions about this stuff. Note: I reference a lot of work by <a href="https://twitter.com/mshelton">Martin Shelton</a>, a researcher at Google. Also, this is a work in progress!</p>

<h2 id="level-1-enable-2-factor-authentication-at-the-very-least-on-your-email">Level 1: Enable 2-factor authentication (at the very least, on your email)</h2>

<p>Turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) for an online account means that whenever you log into the account, a code will be sent to your phone that you‚Äôll have to enter after entering your correct password. The idea here is that even if someone gets ahold of your password, they would also need your phone to get this code.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TMyswLat4xWqrEt8_o7N-Q.png" width="250" align="center" /></p>

<p>You should set up 2-factor authentication for all of your online accounts that support it. Here‚Äôs <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/two-factor-authentication-for-beginners-b29b0eec07d7">a general guide</a>, and here are some how-to guides from some popular services: <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/">GMail</a>, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170388">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/148233965247823">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/enable-two-step-verification">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://twofactorauth.org/">a list of other services</a>. If you enable 2-factor for only one account, do it on your email.</p>

<p>Note: <strong>There are different <em>ways</em> to receive/present this 2nd factor code.</strong> Not all of them are equally secure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Worst: No 2nd-factor at all</li>
  <li>OK: SMS (text message)</li>
  <li>Better: Storing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm">‚Äútime-based one-time password‚Äù</a> (TOTP) in an app on your smartphone like <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en">Google Authenticator</a> or <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>.</li>
  <li>Best: Using a physical security key, like a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/#security-key">YubiKey</a>, as your 2nd factor</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="more-on-security-keys">More on Security Keys</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, you can also use a physical piece of hardware called a security key as your second factor.</p>

<p>Compared to SMS or TOTP (Google Authenticator), a security key is a more secure second factor, since you need the key to login to a new computer. It also helps mitigate phishing attempts better than alternative methods.</p>

<p>One such example of a security key is a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/">YubiKey</a>. Facebook, Twitter, and Google all support using a YubiKey as a second factor. Once you <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/">purchase a YubiKey</a>, you can follow these guides from <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523?hl=en&amp;visit_id=1-636657158187444959-142829807&amp;rd=1">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/security-key-for-safer-logins-with-a-touch/10154125089265766/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication#security-key">Twitter</a>. (Here‚Äôs an <a href="https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006418-using-your-yubikey-with-google">alternate Google guide from Yubico</a> if you need.)</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-if-you-lose-your-phonesecurity-key">What happens if you lose your phone/security key?</h2>

<p>Most services give you <strong>back-up codes</strong> when you enable 2-factor for just this reason (<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538?hl=en">here‚Äôs more info on GMail backup codes</a>). In a pinch, you can use these codes as your 2nd factor.</p>

<p>Store these somewhere safe, like on a piece of paper you store somewhere secure. Once you use a backup code to login, you can choose to temporarily disable two-factor authentication until you get your phone back or get a new one.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-check-which-devices-and-third-party-applications-have-access-to-your-accounts">Level 2: Check which devices and third-party applications have access to your accounts</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs important to periodically check the devices you‚Äôre currently logged into an account with. Here‚Äôs how to‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity?utm_source=google-account&amp;utm_medium=web">Check which devices are logged in to your Google account</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security">Check which devices are logged in to your Facebook account</a> (under ‚ÄúWhere You‚Äôre Logged In‚Äù)</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/settings/applications">Check which devices are logged in to your Twitter account</a> (under ‚ÄúRecently used devices to access Twitter‚Äù).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is something you‚Äôd want to do after you log in to one of these accounts on a hotel or friend‚Äôs computer, or, say, after a breakup. Change your password to these accounts as well (see below for more on passwords).</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also very important to periodically review which third-party applications have access to your accounts. This is because some of these applications may well have permission to read your otherwise private information or even post on your behalf. You should <strong>only keep the access permissions that are absolutely necessary</strong>. Remove any apps you don‚Äôt recognize or look sketchy. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolenguyen/how-to-de-authorize-forgotten-twitter-integrations">BuzzFeed has a good article</a> on this if you want to learn more.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">Check third-party access to your Google account</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/settings/applications?lang=en">Check third-party access to your Twitter account</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications">Check third-party access to your Facebook account</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Google/GMail users should also periodically complete Google‚Äôs <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup">‚ÄúSecurity Checkup‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup">‚ÄúPrivacy Checkup‚Äù</a>.</p>

<h2 id="level-3-use-better-passwords">Level 3: Use better passwords</h2>

<p>You should use long, randomly generated passwords for every account, but even more important is that you should <strong>never reuse passwords</strong> (even if you give them small variations). This is because services get breached and passwords leak all the time, and someone could simply try your password from the leaked service for your other services (you can see which services you use that have been breached at <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a>).</p>

<p>What‚Äôs a good password look like? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vy&lt;{t/W~Ee.5}k(D[Bm(N</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uncoiled armful polymer appeasing shredder recast</code> are both examples of strong passwords. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StarWars13</code>‚Ä¶ not so much.</p>

<p>Since our goal is to not reuse any passwords, we‚Äôre going to have tens if not hundreds of long passwords to remember. The easiest way to handle this problem is to use a <strong>password manager</strong>, which is software that stores all of your passwords within a password ‚Äúvault.‚Äù</p>

<p>As long as you choose a good manager (see below) and make the password to open this vault very strong, you‚Äôll likely be more secure overall.</p>

<p>One way to create a strong, but memorable password is to generate a <em>passphrase</em> <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">using dice</a> (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/">more info on diceware passphrases</a>). This process will create a passphrase like ‚Äúrubdown cytoplasm sculptor kindred unsubtle roamer‚Äù, which should be easy for you to memorize, but very hard for anyone else to guess (<a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">this invaluable xkcd comic explains the concept well</a>).</p>

<h3 id="password-manager-recommendations">Password manager recommendations</h3>

<p>Easiest to use: <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> is an easy-to-use online password manager that has a free option. Here‚Äôs <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/lastpass-for-beginners-e921f35d4114">a beginner‚Äôs guide to LastPass</a> by Shelton.</p>

<p>A solid, paid option: <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> is another popular option, though it costs a fee, paid either monthly or yearly ($36). Here‚Äôs <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/introduction-to-password-managers-5e15baa8b26e">a guide to getting started with 1Password</a> from the same author.</p>

<p>More secure: <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a> is a free, ‚Äúoffline‚Äù password manager, meaning that your encrypted passwords only lives on your computer ‚Äì think of it as Excel For Passwords. I‚Äôve got three guides for you on KeePassXC: <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/keypass-for-beginners-dc8adfcdad54">Shelton‚Äôs</a>, <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-keepassxc">the Electronic Frontier Foundation‚Äôs</a>, and <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2017/06/27/keepassxc-setup-guide.html">mine</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have a manager you like, and a strong vault password, go through each of your online accounts and reset your password to a unique, long, and random password.</p>

<h3 id="dont-get-phished">Don‚Äôt get phished</h3>

<p>Basically don‚Äôt click on sketchy looking links, especially in your email. One apparently common trick is to send you an email (‚ÄúFraud alert‚Äù it might say) with a link to go log into an account, like your bank account. It may <em>look</em> like your bank‚Äôs website, but it could be faked to steal your password. To avoid this, just open your browser and type in your bank‚Äôs website and log in there.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpmyw/fake-gmail-alerts-phishing">some examples of phishing emails</a>. Don‚Äôt click anywhere inside of emails like this!</p>

If you see a suspicious-looking URL and want to check if it‚Äôs safe, <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search">Google has a service for that</a>.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-apps-and-operating-systems-up-to-date">Keep your apps and operating systems up-to-date</h3>

<p>It may be annoying to keep everything up-to-date, but it‚Äôs often important for security. Hackers are constantly looking for vulnerabilities in software, and software companies are constantly ‚Äúpatching,‚Äù or updating their software to prevent this. But you only get the benefit of these patches if you click that sometimes-annoying ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù button, rather than continuously put it off till tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="your-browser">Your browser</h3>

<p>For desktop, <strong><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a></strong> is generally thought of as more privacy-respecting than Google Chrome, but they‚Äôre both good choices. Personally I use both: Chrome when I need to be logged in under my real name (email, banking, most social networking, etc.), Firefox for everything else.</p>

<p>On your iPhone, you can use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firefox-web-browser/id989804926?mt=8">Firefox‚Äôs iOS app</a>, or add a privacy-protecting add-on like to Safari like <a href="https://better.fyi/">Better</a>. Personally I‚Äôve been using <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>, though I‚Äôm keeping an on eye <a href="https://twitter.com/tomscott/status/1076160882873380870">some concerning business practices</a>.</p>

<p>For bumping up your browser security/privacy, I‚Äôd recommend the following extensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a> - Block trackers</li>
  <li>uBlock Origin (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Firefox</a> / <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">Chrome</a>) - Block ads</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> - Ensure you‚Äôre using HTTPS when you can</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to make your Firefox installation more privacy-respecting, you can <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/#fingerprint">follow these steps</a> and, to further disrupt sites that try to track your browsing habits, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">install the Multi-Account Containers add-on</a> and/or the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/">Cookie AutoDelete add-on</a>. You can also change Firefox‚Äôs default search engine from Google to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to browse more anonymously, consider using the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser</a>. However there are some important things to note about the Tor Browser, which Shelton <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/securing-your-digital-life-like-a-normal-person-a-hasty-and-incomplete-guide-56437f127425">summarizes nicely</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tor Browser encrypts your traffic and bounces your secured connection within the Tor network before connecting to the Web from a remote location‚Ä¶ It is important to note that network eavesdroppers can still tell that you‚Äôre using Tor‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey just can‚Äôt tell what you‚Äôre doing within Tor. If you‚Äôre looking for real anonymity, avoid sharing personal information in websites you access through Tor Browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another good resource, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en">Tor‚Äôs official overview</a>, adds: to stay anonymous while using the Tor Browser, ‚Äú[d]on‚Äôt provide your name or other revealing information in web forms.‚Äù In other words, you probably don‚Äôt want to log in to Facebook.</p>

<h3 id="more-secure-textingvoice-callsinstant-messaging">More secure texting/voice calls/instant messaging</h3>

<p>Apple‚Äôs iMessage is pretty secure for everyday use, but if you want to step it up a notch (or you have any Android users in your group text), consider using <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal</a> or <a href="https://wire.com/en/">Wire</a>, which both use ‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù encryption.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, periodically review which devices you‚Äôre logged in on. Both services also support disappearing messages. Here‚Äôs <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/signal-for-beginners-c6b44f76a1f0">a beginner‚Äôs guide to Signal</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/wire-for-beginners-8ee6caef49cb">one for Wire</a>.</p>

<h2 id="level-5-understanding-methods-by-which-your-passwords-can-be-reset">Level 5: Understanding methods by which your passwords can be reset</h2>

<p>This section is probably only necessary for journalists/activists/political folks, but we‚Äôll press on. If someone can easily reset your account‚Äôs password, they can also gain access and lock you out. While this is sometimes mitigated by 2-factor authentication, it‚Äôs worth thinking through some examples.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zm8a9y/how-to-protect-yourself-from-sim-swapping-hacks">SIM-jacking</a> or SIM-swapping is when attackers get your cellphone service provider to route your calls and text messages to their phone rather than yours. They can then (usually) do a bunch of other things at this point, like reset passwords to your online accounts. <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqax3/hackers-sim-swapping-steal-phone-numbers-instagram-bitcoin">Scary</a>, right?</p>

<p>As Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zm8a9y/how-to-protect-yourself-from-sim-swapping-hacks">writes for Motherboard</a>, the general advice to avoid getting SIM-jacked is to consider removing your real phone number from your online accounts. If the online service requires a phone number, consider creating a <a href="https://voice.google.com/">Google Voice</a> phone number for that purpose. Then remove your real phone number from these accounts. Alternatively, you can call up your cell phone service provider and ask to set a PIN that will need to be given to get access to your account.</p>

<h3 id="why-you-may-want-to-disable-sms-password-recovery-altogether">Why you may want to disable SMS-password recovery altogether</h3>

<p>You may want to remove SMS as a password recovery method altogether. This is safer and may be good for your Google account (this is NOT the same thing as SMS as a second authentication factor).</p>

<p>To do this, first go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security">the ‚ÄúSigning in‚Äù section of Google‚Äôs security page</a>. Scroll down a bit to the section titled ‚ÄúAccount recovery options‚Äù. Now remove the ‚ÄúRecovery phone‚Äù option.</p>
