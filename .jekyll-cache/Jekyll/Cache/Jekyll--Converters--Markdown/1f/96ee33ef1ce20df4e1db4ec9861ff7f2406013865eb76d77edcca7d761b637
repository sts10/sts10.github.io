I"Û(<p>Right, so yesterday, July 15th, 2015, was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/15/8968881/amazon-prime-day-best-deals">Amazonâ€™s first â€œPrime Dayâ€</a>. They offered a bunch of deals (which turned out to be <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/15/news/amazon-walmart-prime-day-customers/">pretty</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/shoppers-frustrated-prime-day/">crummy</a>) to their Prime customers. Whatever!</p>

<p>But why did they choose July 15th, a <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-takes-a-victory-lap-for-prime-day/">â€œWednesday in the middle of the summer doldrumsâ€</a>?</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/15/8968881/amazon-prime-day-best-deals">The Verge points out</a>, the company is celebrating 20 years of existence (â€œBezos incorporated the company as â€˜Cadabraâ€™ on July 5th, 1994 and the site went online as Amazon.com in 1995,â€ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com#History">Wikipedia informs</a>). So they could have had this special day on the 5th, right?</p>

<p>But hereâ€™s another theory that came about when one of our editors at BuzzFeed asked this question:</p>

<p>Shafrir then retweeted two of the responses:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/doree">@doree</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/blaiseastra">@blaiseastra</a> It is, going by computer dates!

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>So we have a theory! Amazon selected July 15th, 2015 for their first Prime Day because the date satisfied both of these requirements. The two digit year + month + day must sum to a prime number, and the number of days since January 1st, 1970 (the start of Unix time) must be a prime number as well.</p>

<p>Once I saw this I just had to know two things: (1) How many of these â€œprime daysâ€ had there been since January 1st, 1970, and (2) if Amazon was going to have another Prime Day next year, which dates (if any) would be open to them if they were to stick to both of these requirements?</p>

<p>This little script (also <a href="https://gist.github.com/sts10/a44b0d57e9fdf2f5dca4">a gist</a> that I <a href="https://twitter.com/sts10/status/621352450252009472">tweeted</a>) goes through every day from Jan. 1, 1970 up to today (or whatever date you set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date_to_go_up_to</code> to) and prints out all the â€œprime daysâ€ between those two dates. It also tells you at the end how many â€œprime daysâ€ occurred between the two dates. (The key lines are 16 and 17â€“ the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code> loop and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement.)</p>

<p>Results: Between Jan 1, 1970 and July 15, 2015 there were 447 â€œprime daysâ€. More than I would have thought?</p>

<p>Also, assuming that this new holiday would be successful for Amazon, I assumed they would want to do it again. But July 15th, 2016 definitely would not be a â€œprime dayâ€â€¦ so when would they hold it? Thus I went about finding all the prime days between Jan 1, 2015 and Jan 1, 2017:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>it happened on 2015-03-25 because 16519 and 43 are both prime numbers.

<p>Today, Thursday the 16th, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/16/us-amazon-com-primeday-idUSKCN0PQ29J20150716?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews">Amazon says Prime Day orders beat last yearâ€™s <em>Black Friday</em>, and on Thursday the companyâ€™s shares hit a record high</a>. Thus it makes sense <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-takes-a-victory-lap-for-prime-day/">that theyâ€™re planning to do it again</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œGoing into this, we werenâ€™t sure whether Prime Day would be a one-time thing or if it would become an annual event,â€ Greg Greeley, vice president of Amazon Prime, said in a statement. â€œAfter yesterdayâ€™s results, weâ€™ll definitely be doing this again.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what day will they hold the event next year? And, more importantly, how can I buy $AMZN futures specifically for the weeks of the days in 2016 that I spell out above?</p>
