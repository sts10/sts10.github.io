I"s<p>Thanks in part to my two days of jury duty last week, I was able to speed through two books about information technology and computers recently. The first one, which was recommended to me, is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Master-Switch-Rise-Information-Empires/dp/0307390993/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437012751&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=master+switch"><em>The Master Switch</em></a> by Tim Wu, and the second is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Heroes-Computer-Revolution-Anniversary/dp/1449388396/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437012859&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=hackers"><em>Hackers</em></a> by Steven Levy.</p>
