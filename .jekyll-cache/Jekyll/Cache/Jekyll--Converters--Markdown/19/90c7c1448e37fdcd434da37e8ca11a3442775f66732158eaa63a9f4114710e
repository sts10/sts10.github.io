I"Ï<p>I recently started using a text editor called Vim. For the uninitiated, Vim is a lightweight text editor often used for writing code. It comes pre-loaded on some if not all remote servers. Since itâ€™s designed to be used without a mouse, there are tons of keyboard shortcuts to learn. This part isnâ€™t a huge dealâ€“ for now just know that Vim is a text editor, like Notepad or Sublime Text or Word. (And note that I am still pretty shitty at using it.)</p>
