I"92<p>When I first installed <a href="https://ricochet.im/">Ricochet IM</a> on my machine running Lubuntu, I either ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install ricochet-im</code>, or downloaded it through Ubuntu’s GUI “Software” application. Regardless of which I chose, I think both methods install Ricochet version 1.1.2, as opposed the to latest release: <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/releases/tag/v1.1.4">1.1.4</a>. Considering this is a secure instant messaging app and new versions may contain important security fixes, I wanted to be using the latest version available (which I’m actually thanked in, due to <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/commit/fe40045cec8bed9a735c3cecbcca6ae2276d9902">some extremely minor documentation fixes</a>).</p>

<p>So I went over to <a href="https://ricochet.im/">ricochet.im</a>, found the <a href="https://ricochet.im/releases/1.1.4/">releases page</a> and downloaded the latest release for Linux, which is currently 1.1.4. I’m running Linux on a 64-bit machine (<a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/11/07/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html">an old Macbook Pro</a>), so I went with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ricochet-1.1.4-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2</code>. I downloaded this compressed file to my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Downloads/</code> directory.</p>

<h2 id="verifying-the-downloaded-tar-file">Verifying the downloaded tar file</h2>

<p>To verify the contents of the downloaded tar file, I also downloaded the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.asc</code> signature file associated with the release I downloaded from to the <a href="https://ricochet.im/releases/1.1.4/">releases page</a>. I then went to the <a href="https://ricochet.im/">ricochet.im website</a> and downloaded <a href="https://ricochet.im/john-brooks.asc">John Brooks’ public gpg key</a>.</p>

<p>Then in terminal I navigated to my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Downloads</code> directory (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ~/Downloads</code>) and ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg2 --import john-brooks.asc</code>. gpg2 informed me that 1 key was successfully imported– woohoo. To double check that this was actually John Brooks’ public key that he signs Ricochet releases with, I ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg2 --fingerprint</code> to list the fingerprints of the keys on my key ring. I saw the fingerprint for the Brooks key was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">9032 CAE4 CBFA 933A 5A21 45D5 FF97 C53F 183C 045D</code>, which is exactly the same fingerprint listed in <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet#downloads">the Ricochet Github README</a>.</p>

<p>Next I needed to actually verify the tar file, so I ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg2 --verify ricochet-1.1.4-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2.asc</code>. gpg2 correctly assumed that the signed data was in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ricochet-1.1.4-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2</code> and gave me the message:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gpg: Good signature from "John Brooks &lt;john.brooks@dereferenced.net&gt;" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 9032 CAE4 CBFA 933A 5A21  45D5 FF97 C53F 183C 045D
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, the fingerprint listed on the last line of the output above matches the one listed on <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet#downloads">the Ricochet Github README</a>.</p>

<p>My understanding is that this “Good signature” message means I got a good tar file from the website. The “WARNING” that it’s not a trusted signature just means that I didn’t manually mark John Brooks’ public key as “ultimately trusted” before running the verify command.</p>

<p>For more about this and the process of verifying signatures generally, checkout <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/verifying-signatures/">this page in the Qubes OS documentation</a> and/or <a href="https://keepassxc.org/verifying-signatures">KeePassXC’s page on the subject</a>.</p>

<h2 id="extraction-and-installing">Extraction… and Installing?</h2>

<p>After I found a good signature, I double-clicked the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tar.bz2</code> file to uncompress/extract it (though I understand that I could have been a badass and also <a href="https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/compressed-archives-tar">done this in the terminal</a>).</p>

<p>I then got a new directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ricochet</code> that had subdirectories like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QtQuick</code>, a README file, a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tor</code> I was scared to click, and a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ricochet</code> that when I clicked I got asked what application I wanted to use to open it. I couldn’t figure out how to run the actual Ricochet application– <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/blob/master/packaging/linux-static/content/README">the README</a> didn’t help me much.</p>

<p>So first I Googled (actually Duck Duck Go) something like “ubuntu how to install from tar file” and landed on <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/25961/how-do-i-install-a-tar-gz-or-tar-bz2-file#1030">this askubuntu answer</a>, which talks about opening a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSTALL</code> that I didn’t have, and/or running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./configure</code>, which was returning an error for me.</p>

<p>Eventually, I figured out that I could just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./ricochet</code> from my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ricochet</code> directory and the real application– version 1.1.4– opened right up. Cool. But it would be kind of shitty if I had to first open Terminal, then run a command to launch Ricochet. Ideally I’d have a Ricochet icon in my Lubuntu start menu.</p>

<h2 id="creating-an-icon-in-the-lubuntu-start-menu">Creating an icon in the Lubuntu start menu</h2>

<p>After some more searching I found a subheading on an Ubuntu/Lubuntu help page called <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Windows#How_to_make.2Fadd_an_application_to_the_.22start.22_menu.">“How to make/add an application to the “start” menu.”</a> that described how to make a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.desktop</code> file.</p>

<p>The help page states: “Making a .desktop file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/applications</code> will show the item in the LXDE start menu.”</p>

<p>First I moved my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ricochet</code> directory into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Desktop/my_programs</code>, a directory I made for programs I’ve downloaded through the browser and am not sure where else to put (I know isn’t ideal but I figure it’s better than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Downloads</code>– <a href="https://twitter.com/sts10">hit me on Twitter</a> if you know a better way). Next I confirmed that the new absolute command for launching Ricochet the application was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Desktop/my_programs/ricochet/ricochet</code>, which indeed worked.</p>

<p>Next, as described in the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Windows#How_to_make.2Fadd_an_application_to_the_.22start.22_menu.">help page</a>, I created a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ricochet.desktop</code> text file from scratch in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/applications</code> using a desktop file for another program that was also in that directory as a loose template (the other program is <a href="https://crypto.cat/">Cryptocat</a>, just another program I had previously downloaded that had its .desktop file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/applications</code>).</p>

<p>Here’s the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ricochet.desktop</code> file I typed out in its entirety:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Ricochet
Exec=/home/USER/Desktop/my_programs/ricochet/ricochet
Icon=/home/USER/Desktop/my_programs/ricochet/ricochet.png
Terminal=false
Categories=Network;InstantMessaging;Internet;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And be sure to substitute where it says “USER” for your username. If you’re not sure what your username is, just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> in your terminal.</p>

<p>As you can see, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.desktop</code> format also allows you to specify an icon image, so I went over to <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet">the Ricochet IM Github repo</a> and downloaded <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/blob/master/icons/ricochet.png">a PNG logo</a> and put it in my ricochet directory.</p>

<p>I think I had to restart the machine in order to see the icon appear in the start menu. After restart it was there in “Internet” next to Cryptocat and some other applications.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-havent-figure-out">Things I haven’t figure out</h2>

<p>So running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ricochet</code> from anywhere other than my ricochet directory does not launch the application. I could likely solve this pretty easily with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ln</code> command or a line in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bashrc</code>, but I’ve never need to launch a non-text editor from the command line before.</p>

<p>I’m also not 100% how I’ll go about upgrading to a new version of Ricochet, but the README says “To upgrade, extract the new version to the same location.” I assume I’ll be able to download a new tar file, extract it, and switch it out from old directory. I’ll likely keep the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config</code> directory, as that has my username, contact list, and (I think) my private key (the README notes: “Once you run Ricochet, configuration will be stored in a ‘config’ directory inside this folder”.).</p>

<p>I also might not even have to edit the .desktop file (assuming I put the executable and the PNG icon in the same place).</p>

<h2 id="is-it-supposed-to-be-this-difficult-im-not-even-building-from-source">Is it supposed to be this difficult? I’m not even building from source</h2>

<p>To be honest, I’m too new to Linux/Ubuntu/Lubuntu to know. It does seem strange that there isn’t at least a copy of the Ricochet icon included in the tar that I downloaded. And I could also imagine there being a script that creates and places the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ricochet.desktop</code> file for you. In fact there is a <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/blob/master/src/ricochet.desktop">ricochet.desktop file</a> in the source of the project, but I couldn’t find it in the 1.1.4 tar.</p>

<p>Of course I could have missed some step in the installation that does exactly these things and maybe more. And I should say that this tar I downloaded is meant to serve the needs of many Linux distributions, whose configurations processes may be very different than the ones I took.</p>

<p>Of course this pre-built distribution does take care of a lot of things that could be big headaches, most notable the Tor configuration, which just works. As the README notes: “You do not need to manually run or configure tor. An unmodified tor binary is included with this package, and Ricochet will run it automatically, similiar [sic] to Tor Browser.” which is obviously awesome.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I’ve got version 1.1.4 working and an icon for it in my start menu. I’m not sure how similar the process is on Ubuntu 16.04.</p>

<p>Plus I learned a bit about Linux and Lubuntu. And yes, I did submitted <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/pull/521">a fresh pull request</a> to fix that pesky little typo in the README which has since been merged.</p>
