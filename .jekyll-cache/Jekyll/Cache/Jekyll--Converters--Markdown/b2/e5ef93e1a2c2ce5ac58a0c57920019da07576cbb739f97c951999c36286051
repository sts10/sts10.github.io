I"®˛<p>Back in autumn of 2016 I read three books about technology that left a bit of mark on me: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Freedom-Ethics-Aesthetics-Hacking/dp/0691144613/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479008327&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=coding+freedom"><em>Coding Freedom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary/dp/0596001088/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479008290&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cathedral+bazaar"><em>Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary/dp/0596001088/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479008290&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cathedral+bazaar"><em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></a>.</p>

<p>Broadly, all of them touch on the concept of ‚Äúfree software‚Äù or ‚Äúopen source software‚Äù. I put both of these in quotes because their exact definitions are still a bit fluid‚Äì for example, it‚Äôs still a bit of touchy subject as to whether they are the same concept or two distinct concepts‚Äì but to get us on the same page let‚Äôs quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">the Wikipedia article on free software</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Free software or libre software is computer software distributed under terms that allow users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute it and any adapted versions. Free software is a matter of liberty, not price: users ‚Äîindividually or in cooperation with computer programmers‚Äî are free to do what they want with their copies of a free software (including profiting from them) regardless of how much is paid to obtain the program. Computer programs are deemed free insofar as they give users (not just the developer) ultimate control over the first, thereby allowing them to control what their computers are programmed to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="blooming-most-recklessly">Blooming Most Recklessly</h2>

<p><em>Coding Freedom</em>, which is also <a href="https://gabriellacoleman.org/Coleman-Coding-Freedom.pdf">available for free as a PDF</a>, in particular gradually convinced me that there was something grand about using free software (like Firefox) and that, conversely, some real negatives to using proprietary software (like Microsoft Word).</p>

<p>But first, here are some of more obvious benefits of free software. First of all, the code is open source and thus is public, so anyone can read it and ‚Äúfork‚Äù it in order to add features, find bugs (this is a particularly strong advantage for any software that has to handle secure data, like a password manager or secure messenger), or simply adapt the software to their individual needs.</p>

<p>The fact that the code is public and (legally and technically) free to be adapted also means that there‚Äôs no one company or person that can end the life of a piece of software ‚Äì if there are other developers who want to pick a project up, they can. Or if one team of developers is taking the software down a path that some users don‚Äôt like, it can be ‚Äúforked‚Äù to create a wholly new project (Neovim and <a href="https://keepassxc.org/docs/#faq-keepassx">KeePassXC</a> are two such examples).</p>

<p>While Coleman is interested in those dynamics, her book gets at something a bit larger. Whereas companies make (most) proprietary software, she writes, <em>people</em> make free software, and often in their free time. This means they‚Äôre incentivized by something other than money, which turns out is a really good thing when it comes to writing software. As Coleman writes (page 120):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over years of coding software with other developers in free software projects where discourses about liberty run rampant, many many developers come to view F/OSS as the apex of writing software‚Ä¶ It has, they say, the necessary legal and material features that can induce as well as fertilize creative production. In contrast to the corporate sphere, the F/OSS domain is seen as establishing the freedom necessary to pursue <em>personally</em> defined technical interests in a way that draws on the resources and skills of other individuals who are chasing down their own interests‚Ä¶ One developer told me during an interview that ‚Äúmanagers [‚Ä¶] decide the shape of the project,‚Äù while the F/OSS arena allows either the individual or collective of hackers to make the decision instead. F/OSS allows for technical sovereignty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As software engineer Jessie Frazelle <a href="https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/952946789375729665">puts it</a>, ‚ÄúAs much as you think open source is all about the code, it‚Äôs really about the people.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As much as you think open source is all about the code, it‚Äôs really about the people.</p>&mdash; jessie frazelle (@jessfraz) <a href="https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/952946789375729665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>These hackers, as Coleman often refers to them, don‚Äôt want or need to sell you their product, or the new version of their product, or, crucially, any of their other products. They‚Äôre often making tools that they themselves need or want, and they share them. And through this process there is a sort of technical independence (Coleman 44) gained.</p>

<p>With the peskiness of money out of the way, and armed with modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">technical</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">legal</a> tools that allow for easy and fluid modification and accepted of new code to program (either to fix bugs or add new features), free software projects can take on a life of their own. Earlier in <em>Coding Freedom</em>, quoting another hacker (41):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The important difference for me is whether I come away feeling that I have created something of lasting intrinsic value or not‚Ä¶ [most] often when I am done with corporate software, it‚Äôs dead, and when I am done with free software, it is alive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this reverence for free software wasn‚Äôt made clear from the above quotations, Coleman is more poetic in the beginning of her book (20):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world of hacking, as is the case with many cultural worlds, is one of reckless blossoming, or in the words of Rilke: ‚ÄúEverything is blooming most recklessly; if it were voices instead of colors, there world be an unbelievable shrieking into the heart of the night.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have gotten to bloom some colors myself, albeit small ones; and some of my most significant didn‚Äôt even involve me writing code. As one example, here‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/1113">a bug report I wrote</a> for my password manager, KeePassXC. I had only heard about the bug because an anonymous user had read <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2017/06/27/keepassxc-setup-guide.html">my blog post on the program</a> and contacted me describing a problem. I reproduced the problem he or she was having, and then wrote up the issue in the clearest way I could.</p>

<p>At first, two of the lead developers <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/1113#issuecomment-338902241">dismissed the bug as being impossible</a>. But after a pretty substantial discussion in the comments, most of which I didn‚Äôt quite understand (I don‚Äôt even write C, the language KeePassXC is written in), it was eventually solved with <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/1119">two</a> separate <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/1219">changes</a> to the code (called <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">‚Äúpull requests‚Äù</a> in GitHub lingo), and when the <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/releases/tag/2.2.4">new version</a> of the software was released, every one got access to the improvements for zero dollars. It was a thrill.</p>

<h2 id="baby-steps">Baby Steps</h2>

<p>But could I, personally, switch to using open source software <em>exclusively</em>, not just my password manager? What other software was I using already that was open source? Were there any closed source programs I was using that did not have open alternatives? Maybe I‚Äôd love the open source alternatives.</p>

<p>At first I figured I‚Äôd do things like switch out closed source apps for open source alternatives: from Apple‚Äôs Mail to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> for example, and strive to use <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs largest free, open-source, decentralized microblogging network,‚Äù more and Twitter a bit less. I could try to switch from Microsoft Office to something like <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> (though to be honest I don‚Äôt use Office much these days, and if I do Google Docs works fine for most of my needs). Even using Firefox rather than Chrome would count.</p>

<p>But eventually I realized that if I continued using macOS I would still be using a lot of closed source software as part of the operating system: the file manager, the calculator, the login system, etc. To solve this issue, I would have to leave macOS for an open source alternative‚Äì an open source operating system.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, my trusty MacBook Air had just had its fourth birthday and its 128GB flash hard drive was getting a bit cramped. I was also getting worried about upgrading it past macOS 10.10, as in my experience my Macs got a bit slower with with each OS upgrade beyond the first few. But I‚Äôd been using Apple computers since high school. Could I really <em>not</em> buy a MacBook? Could I leave Apple?</p>

<h2 id="why-not-another-macbook">Why Not Another MacBook</h2>

<p>After more than 500 days without an update (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-20/how-apple-alienated-mac-loyalists">according to Bloomberg</a>), Apple finally <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2016/">unveiled a new MacBook Pro in October of 2016</a>. These new models introduced the Touch Bar and had either two or four Thunderbolt 3 ports.</p>

<p>Given my options as of fall 2017, if I were sticking with Apple I‚Äôd likely have gotten <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro?product=MPXV2LL/A&amp;step=config#">the 13‚Äù Touch Bar model</a> with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of flash storage, and four Thunderbolt ports for $1,999. But a few things about it just didn‚Äôt feel right. It felt safe, in a bad way. MacOS feels tired; the Touch Bar a gimmick; and the 16 GB ceiling limiting.</p>

<h3 id="the-new-macbook-hardware">The New MacBook Hardware</h3>

<h4 id="the-ports">The Ports</h4>

<p>I plug a lot of stuff into my laptop. When I‚Äôm at home I have an external keyboard, a mouse, a second monitor, speakers, and an external hard drive plugged in to my 2012 MacBook Air almost all of the time. This, in addition to the Mag-Safe power plug, occupies almost every port my Air has.</p>

<p>If I went with the MacBook Pro model that only has two Thunderbolt ports, that‚Äôd be one for power (we lose the convenience and safety of Mag-Safe) and another for everything else. Is there a single dongle that accepts two USB ports and a mini-display port or two for external monitors? Or would I have to pay up for the version with four ports?</p>

<p>Of course if I bought <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HKN62/lg-ultrafine-5k-display">this 5K LG monitor for a cool $1,299.95 that Apple sells on its site</a>, I‚Äôd get that monitor and power, plus it‚Äôd 3 extra Thunderbolt ports. But I don‚Äôt want to buy that particular monitor‚Äì I don‚Äôt need 5K resolution and I‚Äôve already got a 27‚Äù Dell monitor that I use with a DVI-to-mini-Display Port converter, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D402Z28/?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAK0B">the updated version of which currently sells for $445</a>.</p>

<p>In practice I think my new Mac would have come with a ticket to <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/mac/mac-accessories/power-cables?page=1#!&amp;f=adapter&amp;fh=4595%2B45b0">dongle city</a>.</p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h4 id="the-keyboard">The Keyboard</h4>

<p>The October 2016 MacBook Pro also featured ‚Äú2nd-gen butterfly mechanism‚Äù keys for the first time. As some users have learned, these can be finicky <em>and</em> expensive to replace. <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life">‚ÄúThe New Macbook Keyboard Is Ruining My Life‚Äù writes Casey Johnston for the Outline</a>: After the keyboard was apparently derailed by a literal piece of dust, Johnston learns or reminds us that ‚Äúall of Apple‚Äôs keyboards are now composed of a single, irreparable piece of technology. There is no fixing it; there is only replacing half the computer.‚Äù</p>

<p>Not only is the keyboard finicky, but clearly the laptop isn‚Äôt designed to be repaired easily, if at all. This also precludes easy upgrading, not only by third parties but also by Apple.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Despite most of us not buying it for years, it‚Äôs worth noting that the last upgradeable Mac laptop went away today. <a href="https://t.co/RGQ1Mf00XQ">https://t.co/RGQ1Mf00XQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/lCPRi4qCCe">https://t.co/lCPRi4qCCe</a></p>&mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/791777687828332544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Later Johnston relates a debatably even more cutting anecdote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Genius shrugged empathetically. He cast around and pointed to a nearby pre-2015 MacBook Pro with relatively thicker keys. ‚ÄúI have one of those,‚Äù he said apologetically. Though Apple employees receive significant yearly discounts on computers, and this was the first significant redesign of the MacBook Pro‚Äôs body in eight years, he had chosen not to buy one of the new ones, even a year later.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-ram-limit">The RAM Limit</h4>

<p>I‚Äôve been a sucker for tons of RAM <a href="https://twitter.com/sts10/status/586217619893653504">for a while now</a>. When I bought my Air in 2012 I chose to max out the RAM to 8 GB. Right now, writing and listening to Spotify with Chrome, Firefox, and Wire running, Activity Monitor tells me I‚Äôm using 6.15 GB of RAM (though <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch">Neofetch</a> reports ‚ÄúMemory: 2949MiB / 8192MiB‚Äù). Thus I‚Äôm glad I chose to bump up the default 4 GB.</p>

<p>But for a new laptop, one that I‚Äôd want to last till 2022 or 2023, I certainly wanted at least 16 GB of RAM, if not 32 GB. However, in 2017, you can‚Äôt buy a laptop from Apple with more than 16 GB. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll want to do with my computer in 2022, but knowing me it‚Äôs a good bet it‚Äôs gonna take more RAM than what I‚Äôm doing right now. As one example, running a virtual machine (or two!) costs RAM.</p>

<!-- For programmer Dibya Chakravorty the 16 GB RAM limit, which is by no means cheap, [felt lacking](https://medium.com/broken-window/my-search-for-a-macbook-pro-alternative-e549ea2b2dee): -->

<!-- > I have been thinking about getting a MacBook alternative for a while. My reasoning is simple. With every passing year, the latest and the greatest in software is becoming more CPU hungry and memory intensive. Therefore, it is important to have at least 16 GB memory and the latest processor in my machine. I can configure my MacBook Pro to have a maximum of 16 GB memory, a dual core 6th generation i7 processor and 512 GB SSD, but this already brings the price to a hefty $2000. If I choose the version with the Touch Bar and Touch Id, then the price is even higher. Other brands are supposedly offering better specs with the same build quality as the Macbook Pro at a much lower cost. It makes sense to check them out. -->

<p>Other specs seem to have flatlined as well. Shortly after the Apple event, Quartz tech reporter Mike Murphy realized he‚Äôd likely be buying a new machine with a <em>slower</em> processor, reflecting the comment by the Apple Genius that Johnston related.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok this just convinced me: I‚Äôm not buying a computer that‚Äôs slower  than my old one<br /><br />(even if it‚Äôs an apples and oranges comparison) <a href="https://t.co/PfL9a3ktAw">pic.twitter.com/PfL9a3ktAw</a></p>&mdash; Mike Murphy (@mcwm) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcwm/status/803769080482103296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2016</a></blockquote>

<h3 id="macos-updates-and-the-apple-eco-system">MacOS Updates and the Apple Eco-System</h3>

<p>Back in 2015 I read an interesting complaint about Mac‚Äôs tied-together ecosystem and pesky requests (or demands) for users to update software in <a href="http://mirrorshades.net/post/132753032310">a blog post</a> by <a href="https://github.com/bdha">Bryan Horstmann-Allen</a> (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/671127035675353088">Paul Ford</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Around OS X 10.9, though, things started going wrong. 10.10 improved a few of these things, but overall it just kept degrading. It‚Äôs slower, there are a lot of really distracting ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù I can‚Äôt seem to actually reliably disable: It‚Äôs tied into my phone, and my wife‚Äôs phone, so when she adds events I get duplicate notifications (deliver once being a fallacy, I suppose), disrupting me from my work. I disable this, but‚Ä¶ It harasses me every day to upgrade. It desperately wants to just upgrade whenever it wants. More and more it acts like the Windows machines I‚Äôve had to support over the last 20 years, which is deeply frustrating. It regularly does things in the background without asking, consuming all my bandwidth‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two months after I read that post, Christine Teigen tweeted something similar:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hate this macbook relationship. &quot;When do you want to update?&quot; &quot;Later&quot; &quot;later today or later tomorrow?&quot; Oh my god just fucking LATER</p>&mdash; christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/690584538121015296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Besides the updates, I‚Äôve had macOS seemingly randomly but frequently ask me for my AppleID password. This frequent ask is made even more annoying because I have two-factor authentication enabled on my Apple account. I‚Äôm still running 10.10 so this may have been improved by now, but, once I enter my text password, I get this cryptic pop-up:</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-id-verification-code-required.png" alt="verification code" /></p>

<p>My iPhone usually gets a verification code, but when I enter my text password with the code tacked on, half the time the prompt just reappears asking for my password again. In addition to this being annoying, it‚Äôs also debatably a security risk, as Apple is training users to enter their Apple ID credentials into a pop-up dialog that appears at seemingly random times. Again, this totally could be an issue with 10.10 that‚Äôs been smoothed out in 10.11+, but still, a company like Apple should support older versions of their OS.</p>

<h3 id="the-ipad-ification-of-the-macbook">The iPad-ification of the MacBook</h3>

<h4 id="touch-bar">Touch Bar</h4>

<p>The addition of a Touch Bar seems like an iPad-ification of my precious platonic ideal of a laptop. Would a DJ really use it? Would I use it when editing video or coding? I‚Äôve gotten pretty efficient with my keyboard and mouse. Admittedly, having a Touch Bar wouldn‚Äôt have <em>prevented</em> me from doing anything I would want to do with a laptop, but if it signals what Apple thinks its customers want, I‚Äôm not too jazzed about the direction.</p>

<p>Owen Williams titled his post about the event <a href="https://medium.com/charged-tech/apple-just-told-the-world-it-has-no-idea-who-the-mac-is-for-722a2438389b">‚ÄúApple just told the world it has no idea who the Mac is for‚Äù</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It took four years to add a touch bar to the keyboard, which delayed any meaningful progress in the meantime? Apple‚Äôs customers are those that need powerful machines, but it delayed them infinitely for what amounts to a vanity project that the core demographic of Apple‚Äôs customers probably won‚Äôt even use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently you can get a new Pro without the Touch Bar, but then you only get two Thunderbolt ports, one of which would be used for charging.</p>

<h4 id="macos-de-prioritization">MacOS De-prioritization</h4>

<p>For me, one of the sharpest arguments against the new MacBooks comes from this Bloomberg story by Mark Gurman two months after the event, which is headlined <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-20/how-apple-alienated-mac-loyalists">‚ÄúHow Apple Alienated Mac Loyalists‚Äù</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interviews with people familiar with Apple‚Äôs inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company‚Äôs software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there‚Äôs no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since then nothing has rekindled any excitement about Apple‚Äôs operating system for me. I haven‚Äôt seen much to write home about in the last couple of macOS versions. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/macos-10-13-high-sierra-the-ars-technica-review/">Ars Technica begins their review of High Sierra</a> (fall 2017): ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve felt like the last few macOS releases have been a little light, High Sierra won‚Äôt change your mind.‚Äù Steady is good, of course, but to me, in addition to the Bloomberg report that there will no longer by a dedicated macOS team, it was more evidence that there likely isn‚Äôt much new and shiny coming down the macOS pipeline.</p>

<p>Then, of course, on November 28th, 2017, we learned that macOS High Sierra had a significant security bug that <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3kvxg5/apple-mac-bug-root-admin-without-password">allows anyone to get admin privileges without a password</a>. Of course all software has bugs, but this one seemed particularly egregious from a company that stresses security and sells on a certain polished-ness.</p>

<p>A month later we learned that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps">Apple plans to let developers write one app for iPhone, iPad, and Mac</a>, which is pretty cool! But it just shows that the ecosystems will be merging even further in the near future.</p>

<p>As if to sum this up, Tim Cook, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/01/21/apples-tim-cook-declares-the-end-of-the-pc-and-hints-at-new-medi/">while speaking about the iPad Pro in January 2016, said</a>, ‚ÄúI think if you‚Äôre looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one?‚Äù (h/t <a href="https://medium.com/charged-tech/apple-just-told-the-world-it-has-no-idea-who-the-mac-is-for-722a2438389b">Owen Williams</a>)</p>

<h3 id="no-one-asks-to-be-buried-with-his-ipad">No one asks to be buried with his iPad</h3>

<p>Allow me yet another detour. In 2015 Tim Wu titled a New Yorker blog post <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/no-one-asks-to-be-buried-with-his-ipad">‚ÄúNo One Asks To Be Buried With His iPad‚Äù</a>. Wu explores this phrase, which has stuck with me, more directly in another post called <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-problem-with-easy-technology">‚ÄúThe Problem with Easy Technology‚Äù</a>, which even features a Steve Jobs reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just how demanding do we want our technologies to be? It is a question faced by the designers of nearly every tool, from tablet computers to kitchen appliances. A dominant if often unexamined logic favors making everything as easy as possible. Innovators like Alan Kay and Steve Jobs are celebrated for making previously daunting technologies usable by anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to see this in the video of the October 2016 Apple event. You can plug the power cord into any of the four Thunderbolt ports! Slide your finger on this pretty screen and your photos get better! It just works! And if, for some weird reason, it doesn‚Äôt, well there‚Äôs always a Genius Bar nearby.</p>

<!-- Like the Touch Bar, I can't help but read into Apple's decision to only provide Thunderbolt 3 ports on their professional laptop. It feels like they're both trying to make everything as plug-and-play as possible, but also trying to use their industry dominance to set a third-party standard. -->

<p>Wu gets much more philosophical in the post, even suggesting that ‚Äúdemanding technology‚Äù is important for human evolution. First, let‚Äôs see his definition of the term: It‚Äôs ‚Äútechnology that takes time to master, whose usage is highly occupying, and whose operation includes some real risk of failure.‚Äù And while he stresses that ‚Äúthere is much to be said for the convenience technologies,‚Äù there‚Äôs something necessary, biologically, to demanding technology:</p>

  <p>The choice between demanding and easy technologies may be crucial to what we have called technological evolution. We are, as I argued <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/02/as-technology-gets-better-will-society-get-worse.html">in my most recent piece in this series</a>, self-evolving. We make ourselves into what we, as a species, will become, mainly through our choices as consumers. If you accept these premises, our choice of technological tools becomes all-important; by the logic of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/01/if-a-time-traveller-saw-a-smartphone.html">biological atrophy</a>, our unused skills and capacities tend to melt away, like the tail of an ape. It may sound overly dramatic, but the use of demanding technologies may actually be important to the future of the human race‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anecdotally, when people describe what matters to them, second only to human relationships is usually the mastery of some demanding tool. Playing the guitar, fishing, golfing, rock-climbing, sculpting, and painting all demand mastery of stubborn tools that often fail to do what we want. Perhaps the key to these and other demanding technologies is that they constantly require new learning. The brain is stimulated and forced to change. Conversely, when things are too easy, as a species we may become like unchallenged schoolchildren, sullen and perpetually dissatisfied.</p>

<h2 id="macbook-alternatives">MacBook Alternatives</h2>

<p>If not a Macbook, then what? I slowly began to do some research.</p>

<p>I started a list of requirements: For hardware, I wrote that I wanted at least 16 GB of RAM, 3 USB ports, 13‚Äù screen at least, and decent battery life. But what about operating system and software?</p>

<p>First off, let‚Äôs get this out of the way early: I did not want to switch to Windows. One of my initial motivations to leave Apple was to use more free and open source software, which Microsoft is very far from. But on top of that, Windows 10 is apparently a bit of privacy nightmare and collects a lot of private information (see: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/even-when-told-not-to-windows-10-just-cant-stop-talking-to-microsoft/">‚ÄúEven when told not to, Windows 10 just can‚Äôt stop talking to Microsoft‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150820/06171332012/windows-10-reserves-right-to-block-pirated-games-unauthorized-hardware.shtml">‚ÄúWindows 10 Reserves The Right To Block Pirated Games And ‚ÄòUnauthorized‚Äô Hardware‚Äù</a>), though <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/windows-10-doesnt-offer-much-privacy-by-default-heres-how-to-fix-it/">there are apparently some steps you can take to protect yourself</a>.</p>

<p>Another intriguing option would have been a <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-chromebook/">Chromebook</a>, but I wanted something with a big hard drive and the ability to easily run a variety of software, not just what I could find in the Android app store or coerce into running on Chrome OS.</p>

<p>Most of  <em>Coding Freedom</em> is about the development of Linux, a <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/COPYING">free</a>/open source operating system started in 1991. Could Linux do all the things I wanted to do?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="so-what-is-linux">So, What is Linux?</h2>

<p>Coincidentally, the <em>New York Times</em> just this week published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/technology/personaltech/taking-a-look-at-linux.html?smid=tw-nytimesbits&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all">a very short ‚Äútech tips‚Äù about Linux as an alternative to Windows</a>. J. D. Biersdorfer writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linux, the open-source operating system project first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, is now used by millions of people on desktop computers, mobile devices and servers; Google‚Äôs Android and Chrome OS even have Linux roots. Because the software has been free and open for developers to enhance and improve for years, Linux is now available in many versions (typically called ‚Äúdistributions‚Äù) that vary in complexity and user interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In terms of being able to do everything a Windows desktop can do, a Linux system is certainly capable of most common tasks, like browsing the web, sending and receiving email, creating documents and spreadsheets, streaming music and editing photos. Many Linux distributions include all the basic programs you need, and you can install others from Linux software repositories online, but make a list of everything you need to do on the computer and make sure you have a Linux solution for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm not going to go in to a ton of specifics about what Linux is or even what it‚Äôs like to use it ‚Äì in my limited experience it‚Äôs generally not significantly different from Windows or macOS from a user‚Äôs perspective (though up to even just a few years ago it sounds like it was much more difficult than its commercial counterparts). But I‚Äôll try to explain one concept about that really pulled me toward it and away from Apple, besides the Rilke.</p>

<h3 id="the-flexibility-of-linux">The Flexibility of Linux</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve already written about free software and some of its (at least theoretical) benefits. Not only is Linux and all the programs it comes with open source, but for the most part all of the software you‚Äôd ever install on a Linux machine will generally need to be open source‚Äì most closed-sourced software (Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, etc.) can‚Äôt run on Linux. I was in fact excited to be forced to find free alternatives to proprietary software like Microsoft Excel and iTunes. But first, more about Linux.</p>

<p>As Biersdorfer writes, Linux comes in different versions, known as distributions (examples include Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, Manjaro, Arch, etc.). <em>Additionally</em>, most of these distributions can use a variety of different <em>desktop environments</em> (e.g. Gnome, KDE, Xfce, etc.). A desktop environment is the part of the operating system that the user interacts with most ‚Äì it includes the file manager, the menus like wifi, date and time, etc., some the default applications, notifications, all that stuff. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment">Wikipedia defines it as</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer operating system, which share a common graphical user interface (GUI), sometimes described as a graphical shell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here‚Äôs a nice video that shows five different desktop environments available to most Linux users:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBz5A-fqnb4" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>That YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTfabOKD7Yty6sDF4POBVqA">Joe Collins</a>, has a slightly more involved and technical video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzhNDlz8X2s">‚ÄúThe Linux Desktop Demystied‚Äù</a> that helped me better understand some of the ins and outs. He‚Äôs also got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wbVtMJrljsQ?start=402">another video on the Gnome 3 desktop environment specifically</a>. (There are tons of great videos about Linux on Youtube, and I learned a lot from them.)</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it is not too difficult to install a completely new distribution or DE, and of course it costs nothing (you just have to be sure to back-up your files first in some cases). In fact it seems common enough that there‚Äôs a subreddit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroHopping/">DistroHopping</a> where users discuss their frequent distribution (‚Äúdistro‚Äù) changes and installations.</p>

<p>This flexibility ‚Äì being able to choose not only the Linux distribution you want, but also what desktop environment ‚Äì seems very powerful to me. For example, <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/11/07/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html">when I installed wanted to try installing Linux on my 2009 MacBook</a>, I knew it was underpowered in terms of resources by modern standards, particularly in terms of RAM. After some research I opted for Ubuntu for a distribution and a desktop environment called Xfce, since I had learned that that combination did not require a lot of resources, including RAM. It‚Äôs not blazing fast, but it runs pretty well!</p>

<p>By contrast, there are of course no distributions of MacOS, and Apple only offers one desktop environment (which I believe is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(user_interface\)">Aqua</a>). I‚Äôm almost positive that my 2009 MacBook Pro would barely be able to run macOS High Sierra.</p>

<p>This flexibility also offers a certain amount of protection against any design changes that a given distribution‚Äôs or DE‚Äôs developers choose to implement ‚Äì if a user disagrees with a sharp change, he or she can just install a new distro or DE easily and at no cost. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/macos-10-13-high-sierra-the-ars-technica-review/">Apple doesn‚Äôt make a ton of changes to macOS these days</a>, but if they did, regular Mac users wouldn‚Äôt have much recourse. By contrast, some Linux distributions like <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a> push significant changes on a rolling schedule, since they‚Äôre confident their users want to be on a bleeding edge, while others, like <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, move very slowly and cautiously.</p>

<h2 id="but-can-linux-do-everything-i-need-it-to-do">But Can Linux Do Everything I Need it to Do?</h2>

<p>At some point early on in my search I wrote out a quick list of things I primarily used my Macbook Air for, as Biersdorfer advises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet browsing (Chrome? Chrome extensions? TweetDeck?)</li>
  <li>Writing and running code (Vim, Ruby, etc.)</li>
  <li>Instant Messaging (gchat, etc.)</li>
  <li>Playing MP3s</li>
  <li>Spotify</li>
  <li>Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, etc.</li>
  <li>Password management (1Password?)</li>
  <li>Use GPG through a GUI application</li>
</ul>

<p>Could I do all of these things on a computer running Linux? To find out, I needed a computer with Linux on it to play with. Cue research montage: I started reading a bunch of subreddits every day, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux">r/linux</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs">r/linux4noobs</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnLaptops">r/LinuxOnLaptops</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu">r/Ubuntu</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware">r/linuxhardware</a>. By November 7th, after a couple of false starts I successfully got <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/11/07/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html">Ubuntu installed on an old MacBook Pro</a>. Ubuntu, I had learned, was one of the ‚Äústarter‚Äù Linux distributions.</p>

<p>One of the first things I did on Ubuntu was to create a spreadsheet using <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>‚Äì a suite of free software that emulates Microsoft Office and is included with Ubuntu 16.04. I called the first column ‚ÄúTask name‚Äù and a second labeled ‚ÄúResult‚Äù and slowly went down the list.</p>

<p>The tl;dr here is that, as Biersdorfer writes, Linux <em>can</em> handle most of my common tasks. I really only have two major hang ups at this point: I can‚Äôt run iMessage, and while Hulu works in Chrome, I still haven‚Äôt gotten HBO Go to work. I worked around these problems: Most people I text with have moved away from iMessage, and since I pay for HBO through my Hulu account, I can watch HBO content through <a href="https://beta.hulu.com">Hulu‚Äôs new-ish beta site</a>, which works on Linux in Chrome.</p>

<!-- On the 12th, tangentially relatedly, I pushed [a blog post about some privacy and security measures I had taken recently](https://sts10.github.io/2016/11/12/some-privacy-and-security-measures.html) -->

<h2 id="what-its-like-to-install-software-on-linux">What It‚Äôs Like to Install Software on Linux</h2>

<p>How you install software on Linux depends quite a bit on which distro you‚Äôre running. For a popular distribution called Ubuntu, there are a number of ways. The simplest is to use the built-in application store, which is very similar to Apple‚Äôs. Other times the recommended installation process is to download an installer, often with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.deb</code> extension, similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dmg</code> files for MacOS.</p>

<p>But often times a piece of software requires users to run a command or two from the command line (there‚Äôs a general assumption that if you‚Äôre running Linux, you at least know how to open a terminal and run a command). For example, <a href="https://signal.org/download/">installing the Signal desktop client</a> on Mac follows the familiar flow of downloading an installer file. By contrast, for Debian-based Linux (Ubuntu is Debian based), users need to run these three commands in the terminal:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl <span class="nt">-s</span> https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt/keys.asc | <span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-key add -
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"deb [arch=amd64] https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt xenial main"</span> | <span class="nb">sudo tee</span> <span class="nt">-a</span> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/signal-xenial.list
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>signal-desktop
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you run those three commands Signal is installed. You don‚Äôt need to write any code, but you do have to often paste commands like these into the terminal to install software on Linux. But I consider this one of Wu‚Äôs technological demands.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-modern-computer-to-buy-to-run-linux">Finding a Modern Computer to Buy to Run Linux</h2>

<p>Over the next few months I filled out a different spreadsheet with a number of laptops that either came with Linux on them or that I could easily install Linux on. I found that some companies sell computers with Linux already installed. With these computers, not only could I expect everything to work better out of the box, but I‚Äôd likely benefit from some support from the company, which, as a Linux newbie, I figured couldn‚Äôt hurt.</p>

<p>By now my loose hardware criteria was 16 GB or more of RAM, 512 GB of flash storage, 13‚Äù to 15‚Äù screen, plenty of ports, all for somewhere around $1,800. I also wanted the laptop to be able to run two external monitors if I wanted ‚Äì this proved to be one of the hardest requirements to fulfill.</p>

<p>I soon found that Dell sells some of its laptops with an option to have Ubuntu installed on it rather than Windows, including one its newer and more sleek models, <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/xps-13-developer-edition/spd/xps-13-9360-laptop/cax13w10p7b5135ubuntu">the XPS 13</a> (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/06/the-xps-13-de-dell-continues-to-build-a-reliable-linux-lineage/">‚ÄúThe XPS 13 DE: Dell continues to build a reliable Linux lineage,‚Äù Ars Technica wrote at the time</a>). This is thanks to a team at Dell known as ‚ÄúProject Sputnik‚Äù that pre-installs Ubuntu on Dell computers, making sure they run it smoothly. The team recently celebrated <a href="https://bartongeorge.io/2017/11/29/project-sputnik-turns-five/">its 5th anniversary</a>, so clearly they‚Äôre doing something to please the Dell executives. (You can watch <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/01/dell-talk-linux-laptops-distros-sales">a 2017 interview with the team‚Äôs leader Barton George</a>.)</p>

<p>In addition to the XPS 13, Dell also currently offers Ubuntu on their <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/precision-15-3520-laptop/xctop3520hwus?oc=xctop3520hwus&amp;selectionState=eyJGUHJpY2UiOjg5MS4yNiwiT0MiOiJ4Y3RvcDM1MjBod3VzIiwiUXR5IjoxLCJNb2RzIjpbeyJJZCI6MTEsIk9wdHMiOlt7IklkIjoiVUJVTlRVIiwiUHJpY2UiOjE3LjM4fV19LHsiSWQiOjEwMDIsIk9wdHMiOlt7IklkIjoiTk9QU1cifV19LHsiSWQiOjM3MiwiT3B0cyI6W3siSWQiOiJOT09QVCJ9XX0seyJJZCI6NzQ5LCJPcHRzIjpbeyJJZCI6IkMxNVNNTCJ9XX0seyJJZCI6MTAwMywiT3B0cyI6W3siSWQiOiJVQlVOVFUifV19XX0%253D">New Precision 3520</a>, <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/precision-15-5520-laptop/xctop5520hwus?oc=xctop5520hwus&amp;selectionState=eyJGUHJpY2UiOjEwOTguMjUsIk9DIjoieGN0b3A1NTIwaHd1cyIsIlF0eSI6MSwiTW9kcyI6W3siSWQiOjExLCJPcHRzIjpbeyJJZCI6IlVCVU5UVSIsIlByaWNlIjoxNi4yNX1dfSx7IklkIjoxMDAyLCJPcHRzIjpbeyJJZCI6Ik5PUFNXIn1dfSx7IklkIjozNzIsIk9wdHMiOlt7IklkIjoiTk9PUFQifV19LHsiSWQiOjc0OSwiT3B0cyI6W3siSWQiOiJDSTVTTUwifV19LHsiSWQiOjEwMDMsIk9wdHMiOlt7IklkIjoiVUJVTlRVIn1dfV19">New Precision 5520</a> and <a href="http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=xctop752015_us_sapp&amp;model_id=precision-15-7520-laptop&amp;c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=04">New Precision 7520</a>, among others. It was weirdly difficult for me to find a clean list of all of their Ubuntu offerings, and in general their website is ugly and hard to use, though I think they do have <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/555/campaigns/xps-linux-laptop_us">a landing page for ‚ÄúUbuntu-based Developer and Engineering systems‚Äù</a>.</p>

<p>I also found about a company called <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> based in Colorado that basically buys laptop shells from China and other parts, assembles it all, and puts either Ubuntu or their new distribution, which has the ridiculously-stylized name of <a href="https://system76.com/pop">Pop!_OS</a>, on it for you. The models I considered were <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/lemur">the Lemur</a>, <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/oryx">Oryx Pro</a>, and their new <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/galago">Galago Pro</a>.</p>

<p>I had read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnThinkpads/">on Reddit</a> that ThinkPads ‚Äì both old/used and new ‚Äì were good candidates for installing Linux on yourself. Among the new options, the <a href="http://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-t-series/T470/p/22TP2TT4700">T470</a> and <a href="http://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-t-series/T470s/p/22TP2TT470S">T470s</a> looked particularly strong (the T470s is <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-business-laptops/">Wirecutter‚Äôs pick for best business laptop</a>), as well as the <a href="http://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-p/P50s/p/20FLCTO1WWENUS1?configuratorMode=compact#tab-customize">P50s</a>.

<p>I also put MacBook Pro and Air options into the spreadsheet for comparison.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with the <strong>Dell</strong>.</p>

<p>I think I wrote off the Dells early partially because I owned and used their desktops, running Windows, as a kid and so the idea of returning to that hardware felt boring. That said, I think that 5520 is a pretty safe, not exotic choice. I could likely connect two external monitors to it using the HDMI and the Thunderbolt ports, and even if that didn‚Äôt work I think I could use something like the <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-business-thunderbolt-dock-tb16-with-240w-adapter/apd/452-bcnu/pc-accessories">Dell Business Thunderbolt Dock - TB16</a> to get a bunch more ports for an extra $350. Since I made my choice (no spoilers!), Dell has released <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/01/new-dell-xps-13-developer-edition-2018">an updated XPS 13 that looks pretty great</a>.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt put much effort into looking into the <strong>ThinkPad</strong> options either. The idea of wiping Windows and installing Linux myself, with no official support at all, daunted me. I‚Äôll also note that I was shocked by hard it was to navigate the Dell and ThinkPad websites.</p>

<p>The <strong>Galago Pro</strong> is System76‚Äôs newest laptop. It‚Äôs about the size of my trusty MacBook Air, with a few more ports and a HiDPI screen standard (which is kind of like Apple‚Äôs Retina screens).</p>

<p>Overall it seems like a pretty great laptop, and a good choice for anyone who has read this far. However I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfz2T2fZjbI">a review on YouTube</a> that found a few dealbreakers. This reviewer thought that the graphics card and other hardware included in the Galago Pro weren‚Äôt quite powerful enough for the 3200 px by 1800 px HiDPI screen. There‚Äôs also an issue of how well Linux handles HiDPI screens, especially when plugging in external monitors that are not HiDPI (though System76 have worked on this issue with their own distribution, Pop!_OS). Lastly, some older applications don‚Äôt work well with HiDPI screens.</p>

<p>As I understand it, one workaround is that you can just run the screen at lower resolution, like 1920 by 1080 pixels, and avoid almost all of these issues. But I was worried the company had made other sacrifices for portability that might not be obvious to me right way. For example, battery life on the Galago Pro, according to a few reviewers, is only about four hours. And that same YouTube review shows how flimsy the top half of the laptop is.</p>

<p>Overall I think the Galago Pro is a pretty solid choice for most people. I‚Äôm curious what they change in the next version. But for me, especially after I looked at the Oryx Pro, I wanted something with more power, and I was willing to sacrifice a lot of portability for it.</p>

<h2 id="the-oryx-pro">The Oryx Pro</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/oryx">Oryx Pro</a> is the computer I finally bought in November 2017, almost a year after making my original spreadsheets.</p>

<p>I got the model with a 15.6‚Äù screen and configured it with an i7-7700HQ processor (2.8 GHz up to 3.8 GHz), 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, a 512 GB NVMe solid state hard drive with an additional 1 TB hard drive, and a Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card (6 GB). It‚Äôs given weight is 5.5 lbs and its dimensions are 15.2‚Ä≥ √ó 10.7‚Ä≥ √ó 0.9‚Ä≥ (38.51 √ó 27.10 √ó 2.49 cm). It‚Äôs also got a ton of ports, including 2 MiniDisplay ports, 3 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports, an Ethernet port, and more. It‚Äôs not super pretty (here‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57JwEdPRUE">a video that gives you a good look at it</a>), but it is, by almost any measure, a beast of a laptop.</p>

<p>System76 currently offers a choice of two distros: Ubuntu 16.04 or their own distro, called <a href="https://system76.com/pop">Pop!_OS</a>, which is of course free and <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/pop">on GitHub</a>. But given how similar different versions of Linux are, I figured I could put any distribution on it that I wanted on it. Thus I was mostly looking at it from a hardware prospective. I can now agree with most reviews I read: it feels pretty sturdy. The trackpad is fine‚Äì I appreciate the dedicated buttons ‚Äì and while the keyboard isn‚Äôt as ‚Äúsnappy‚Äù as on my Air, I actually like it. Though I knew I would be mostly using <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2014/12/06/an-update-to-my-keyboard-game.html">my mechanical keyboard</a> and <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/product/g602-wireless-gaming-mouse">a Logitech mouse</a>.</p>

<p>Given the choice of those two distros, I opted for System76‚Äôs new, homegrown distribution, Pop!_OS, which comes with a desktop environment called Gnome. This combination, thanks in part to efforts of System76‚Äôs engineers, work well together out of the box. I paid about $2,200, with some savings from their holiday sale.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-system76">A Note on System76</h3>

<p>Let me just note here that one of the less tangible things I bought with my Oryx Pro was support from System76. While I only got the minimum 1 year warranty for ‚Äúlimits parts and labor,‚Äù the company says they offer a lifetime of Linux support. This was heartening, since in abandoning Apple I was also losing all those Genius Bars! And while I had witnessed how helpful the online Linux community was, I wanted something a little more than that if I was going to dump more than $2,000 into a machine ‚Äì far more than I‚Äôve spent on any one Apple product.</p>

<p>Also, from my perspective the people at System76 seem almost comically awesome. One of their engineers <a href="https://mastodon.rocks/@cassidyjames/99289298842949288">answered</a> a number of questions I threw at him on Mastodon. Another is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH5JgMlNE8o">building an operating system written in Rust as a side project</a>. I haven‚Äôt asked a question any questions through the official System76 support portal, but I have no reason to think they wouldn‚Äôt handle it quickly and thoroughly.</p>

<p>After I had an ordered my Oryx Pro, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/intel-management-engine-vulnerabilities-pcs-servers-iot/">a security issue involving something called Intel‚Äôs Management Engine was made public</a>. System76 promptly announced that it was <a href="http://blog.system76.com/post/168050597573/system76-me-firmware-updates-plan">disabling it in all of its laptops, including the ones it sold in the past few years, through a firmware update</a>, something that <a href="https://liliputing.com/2017/12/dell-also-sells-laptops-intel-management-engine-disabled.html">Dell is only doing on some very expensive models</a>. To explain their reasoning, System76‚Äôs CEO and one of their engineers did an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MujjuTWpQJk">interview</a> with Bryan Lunduke about it (Note: System76 is a sponsor of Lunduke‚Äôs YouTube show, which he discloses in the interview), plus another engineer held <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7gpcu5/system76_will_disable_intel_management_engine_on/dqktr8m/">an impromptu AMA on a Reddit post about the Intel ME issue</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, reflecting their commitment to some of the ethos Coleman discusses, I love how the fourth link down on <a href="http://pop.system76.com/docs/">their Pop!_OS documentation page</a> is titled <a href="http://pop.system76.com/docs/bite-sized-bugs/">‚ÄúGetting Started with Bitesize Bugs‚Äù</a>, which outlines the process of fixing small bugs in their operating system. It‚Äôs almost impossible to imagine Apple having something like that.</p>

<p>OK so I like the company, but what kind of free software would I have to be using with Linux?</p>

<h2 id="what-software-im-using-on-linux">What Software I‚Äôm Using on Linux</h2>

<p>Overall I haven‚Äôt had to sacrifice much. (<a href="http://support.system76.com/articles/switch/">System76 wisely has an article on switching from Apple</a>.) The category where Linux and free software is furthest behind seems to be in photo and video editing ‚Äì think about Adobe‚Äôs monopoly on that sector.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> instead of Microsoft Office</strong>: Seems fine. Again, I rarely used Office on my Mac. I suppose if I have to make a spreadsheet and chart at home I‚Äôll have to Google ‚ÄúLibre Office calc [my problem]‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúExcel [my problem]‚Äù to get help, but I‚Äôll take my chances. I also of course can still use Google Docs and Google Sheets.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.libreoffice.org/assets/Uploads/Discover/LO52-Screenshots/lo52-writer-01.png" alt="Libre Write screenshot" /></p>

<p><img src="https://www.libreoffice.org/assets/Uploads/Discover/LO52-Screenshots/lo52-calc-01.png" alt="Libre Calc screenshot" /></p>

<p>For <strong>code editing</strong> I‚Äôm using <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, which I used on macOS as well. (<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/linux_repositories.html">Sublime</a> and <a href="https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#platform-linux">Atom</a> both offer Linux apps if you prefer those editors.) As you might have guessed, Linux is very similar to Mac from the command line: <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv">rbenv</a> for Ruby and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-01-installation.html">Rustup</a> work just as they do on macOS.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sts10/vim-pink-moon/master/img/pink-moon-frontend.png" alt="Neovim" /></p>

<p><strong>For my browser, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a></strong></p>

<p>Firefox seems to be the default on most Linux distributions, including Pop!_OS. Firefox, luckily, just released a much-improved version, 57. However I ended up installing Chrome to get Hulu to work, which I feel bad about because Chrome is not free software, but it‚Äôs an example of one case where Linux can run non-free software.</p>

<p><strong>For password manager I switched almost completely to <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>.</strong> I had been using 1Password, but they don‚Äôt have a native app for Linux. Though recently 1Password released <a href="https://support.1password.com/getting-started-1password-x/">1Password X</a>, a browser extension solution for password management that apparently works on all operating systems. I don‚Äôt see why the LastPass browser extension wouldn‚Äôt work on Linux.</p>

<p>For <strong>chat/IM</strong>, I‚Äôm pretty sure I can run gchat in Chrome through gmail‚Äôs web interface if I need to. However over the course of the last year I‚Äôve moved most of my friends to other messaging services like Wire or Signal, both of which offer Linux apps. One bummer here, as mentioned, is that I can‚Äôt run iMessage, but I can obviously still send iMessages from my iPhone.</p>

<p>For <strong>cloud-synced notes</strong> I use <a href="https://standardnotes.org/">Standard Notes</a>, which has a Linux app. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux">DropBox works on Linux too</a> if that‚Äôs your bag.</p>

<p>For updating my personal website I can keep my <strong>FTP client</strong>, <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>, a free application that I had been using on my Mac. For <strong>making GIFs</strong> I was sad to give up GIF Brewery and GIPHY Capture, but I‚Äôve been playing with <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/03/peek-gif-recorder-1-0-flatpak">Peek</a>. <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> works just fine on Linux for playing videos. If I used an email client, I‚Äôd likely install <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>, but so far I‚Äôve been using GMail‚Äôs web interface in Chrome, which works normally.</p>

<p>For more on what I did when I initially booted up Pop!_OS, here‚Äôs a Github repo <a href="https://github.com/sts10/linux-config">where I took notes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="software-ill-eventually-install">Software I‚Äôll Eventually Install</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For RAW photo editing I‚Äôll have to give up Adobe Lightroom for something like <a href="https://www.darktable.org/">Dark Table</a>. I haven‚Äôt installed Dark Table yet though‚Äì that‚Äôll be a project for another day.</li>
  <li>For editing video, which I generally only do at work, there‚Äôs <a href="https://kdenlive.org/">Kdenlive</a> and <a href="https://www.openshot.org/">Openshot</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/12/spotify-now-available-snap-app-ubuntu">Spotify runs on Linux</a>, which is super cool. But for playing MP3s, there are a lot of options here. Two I‚Äôve heard good things about are <a href="https://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gnumdk/lollypop/">Lollypop</a>. Honestly I‚Äôm pretty confident I can find something better than iTunes, which doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of a focus for Apple in recent years.</li>
</ul>

## One Month On

So, do I now only use free software? Well, no. As mentioned Chrome and Spotify are not free. And I could go even farther, behind the software on my computer to services I use on the internet--

<h2 id="should-i-switch-to-linux">Should I Switch to Linux?</h2>

<p>First off, I have glossed over a lot of little tricky things I had to either know or do to feel comfortable using Linux. I‚Äôm really glad I took a year to learn about little things, like the difference between X Org and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_%28display_server_protocol%29">Wayland</a>, the pros and cons of using Nvidia drivers, what a <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/4983/what-are-ppas-and-how-do-i-use-them">PPA</a> is and how they‚Äôre different from snaps, etc.. And I‚Äôm also glad that I was already comfortable using a terminal (as we saw, even installing software sometimes requires using the command line. While many distros, including Pop!_OS, have GUI software stores similar to Apple‚Äôs App Store (except that EVERYTHING IS FREE), I‚Äôm not sure I can recommend Linux to users who have never touched a command line.)</p>

<p>In general I‚Äôm glad I was able to deal with a little messiness, to not be too pissed when something breaks and I need to Google an error message with the faith that someone has had it before and recorded how they fixed it, so I can solve it without an appointment at the Apple Genius Bar and maybe learn something about computers in the process.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs pretty great to be at least a little more free, blooming a few more colors.</p>
