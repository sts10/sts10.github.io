I"ƒ<p>Phew! My brain has been hurting (in a good way) for the first time in years. Looking back over the last 7 days, Iâ€™d say I spent at least 14 hours a day dealing with code. The best metaphor I can think of is that part in the Matrix when they plug Keanu Reeves in so he can learn things quickly. Thatâ€™s what it feels like.</p>

<p>Not to imply that itâ€™s been all easy-going exactly. At any point this past week when I thought I was â€œgetting itâ€ seemingly minutes later Iâ€™d get hit with a new lab or concept in lecture that, as one student put it, knocked me on my ass. Thursdayâ€™s Ruby labs and this weekendâ€™s homework were especially challengingâ€” iterating through nested hashes is NOT fun. And Iâ€™m sure next week will only move faster, but Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m learning to cope with the inevitable setbacks frustrations of <strong>THE STRUGGLE</strong> earlier rather than later. Doing 10 push-ups or walking to get a sandwich does wonders.</p>

<p>I did make some progress on my first outside-of-class project, <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2014/02/06/octo-new-making-octopress-easier-with-bash.html">ink</a>. I was able to separate the bulk of the code out to a shell file, allowing me to easily track it with Git. So I went ahead and pushed <a href="https://github.com/sts10/ink">the repository to GitHub</a>. Plenty of code to refactor and features to add, if youâ€™re so inclined!</p>
