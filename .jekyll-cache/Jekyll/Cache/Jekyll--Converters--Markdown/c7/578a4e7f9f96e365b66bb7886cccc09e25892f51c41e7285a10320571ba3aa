I"|<p>This post is a bit of a sequel to my post about <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/11/07/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html">installing Ubuntu on my old Macbook Pro</a>. This is just a collection of notes on improvements Iâ€™ve made to my Ubuntu 16.04 Unity installation, the bulk of which has been changing my desktop environment from Unity to other options.</p>
