I"Ë<p>Today Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/sharing-block-lists-to-help-make-twitter-safer">announced that users can export and import lists of blocked users</a>. I donâ€™t have the feature on my personal account yet, but a co-worker did and I saw that when you do export, you download a CSV file (Comma Separated Valuesâ€“basically a software-agnostic spreadsheet). Iâ€™m assuming the import side of the feature expects the same file format.</p>
