I"_<p>When I started using Vim the first plugin I downloaded was <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NERDTree</a>, a sidebar file explorer similar to what the text editor I was leaving, Sublime Text, had. It was a good crutch to get me into managing multiple files in Vim, but as I get more comfortable in Vim Iâ€™m running into a problem detailed in <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/">this Vimcasts blog post</a>, namely that when you open or split a new file from NERDTree, it is difficult to predict where the new window will open.</p>
