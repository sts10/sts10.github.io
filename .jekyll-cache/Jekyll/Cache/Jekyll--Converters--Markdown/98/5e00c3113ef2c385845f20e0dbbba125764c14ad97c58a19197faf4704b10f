<p>At the end of this past week we dug deeper into object-oriented programming— by which I mean using Ruby classes as models of things like jukeboxes, songs, schools, and students. At the same time, our programs grew from simple, single-file projects rarely exceeding 100 lines to folders containing multiple files within subfolders all interacting with each other just so.</p>

<p>And, as usual, while it all made sense in lecture, this weekend’s homework defeated me pretty decisively. I’ve since worked it out (gotta pay attention to your accessors!), but I’m also trying to embrace the value of having been defeated. Onward.</p>
