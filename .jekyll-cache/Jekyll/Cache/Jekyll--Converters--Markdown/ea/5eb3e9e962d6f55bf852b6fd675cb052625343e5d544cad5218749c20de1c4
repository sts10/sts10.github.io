I"<p>I was browsing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sts10/m/vim_multi">my vim multireddit</a> today and, a few turns down a rabbit hole, found a Chrome Extension called <a href="https://vimium.github.io">Vimium</a>. It’s purpose is to provide Vim-like keyboard shortcuts for navigating the web. Here is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">the link to the Chrome Store page</a>.</p>

<p>The default key mappings are spelled out in <a href="https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/README.md">the GitHub repo’s ReadMe</a>. However the scroll bindings and link opening commands seemed a bit much for me. Plus the tab navigation seems redundant to me, considering the Chrome already has good shortcuts for tab navigation (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + shift [</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + &lt;tab number&gt;</code>, plus <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + t</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + w</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + Shift + t</code> [reopen last closed tab]), all of which I’ve become trained to use.</p>

<p>But there are some tricks and functionality that Vimium genuinely adds to Google Chrome. By that I mean not only does it make functions you could do in default Chrome with a mouse accessible via keyboard shortcut (like pin tab), but it adds functions that, to my knowledge, users simply could not do in default Chrome (for example: search open tabs and close tabs to the left). These are the commands I was and am most interested in adding via this extension.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>However I knew I probably didn’t want to have a keyboard shortcut for <em>every</em> Vimium command. I wanted to be able to pick and choose which mappings were enabled. Wonderfully, Vimium accepts custom key mappings in a nifty, simple text-field in the extension’s options menu.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NE6CtIe.png" alt="Partial view of Vimium options menu" /></p>

<p>You can even clear all default mappings by starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unmapAll</code>. After that, users are free to specify only the mappings that they want.</p>

<p>So here is my first stab at my custom key mappings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>unmapAll
map &lt;a-p&gt; togglePinTab
map &lt;c-p&gt; Vomnibar.activateTabSelection
map yy copyCurrentUrl
map yt duplicateTab
map vs toggleViewSource
map / enterFindMode
map n performFind
map N performBackwardsFind
map &lt;c-h&gt; moveTabLeft
map &lt;c-l&gt; moveTabRight
map &lt;a-h&gt; closeTabsOnLeft
map &lt;a-l&gt; closeTabsOnRight
map ? showHelp
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="notable-mappings">Notable Mappings:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a-p&gt;</code> (meaning alt-p) pins current tab– a shortcut I’ve always wanted.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;c-p&gt;</code> (control-p) searches your open tabs– super awesome for users like me who often have a ton of tabs open at once. It’s actually what seems like a fuzzy search, which is dope. (I chose control-p after <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">a Vim plugin I use called ctrlp</a> that performs a similar operation in Vim.)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yt</code> - As with pin tab, I always wanted a keyboard shortcut for duplicating the current tab.</li>
  <li>the Find mode stuff is straight Vim– I’m going to give it a try, since you can navigate to the next and previous matches straight from the keyboard.</li>
  <li>And lastly I have some commands to move tabs and close tabs to the left and right of the current tab. You can right-click a tab and choose to close tabs to the right of it, which is super useful. But now I can close to the left as well, and both without leaving the home row of the keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again note, <strong>search open tabs</strong> and close tabs to left and  are new functions! Very cool!</p>

<p>For the record, here are all the Vimium commands that are available to be mapped (including the advanced commands), which I found by clicking the “Show available commands” link next to the “Custom key mappings” text-field:</p>
