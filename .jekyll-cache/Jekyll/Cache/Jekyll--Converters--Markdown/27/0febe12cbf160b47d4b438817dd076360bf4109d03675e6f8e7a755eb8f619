I"t<p>When I was moving around <a href="http://www.watchpeoplecode.com/">Watch People Code</a> the other day while figuring out how to livestream my work on <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2015/08/07/from-terminal-vim-to-mac-vim.html">a new project</a>, I found a interview by the site’s administrator, <a href="https://github.com/eleweek">Alexander Putilin</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/justinmk">Justin M. Keyes</a>, a contributor to an open-source project called <a href="http://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7z2GQr9-tg">video of the interview</a>:</p>

<p>Neovim is a new version of a classic text editor called Vim, which I’ve become more interested in the last few months.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting interview as it offers a view into the problems and joys of running a loosely-organized open source project, with references to something he calls “the trust model.”</p>

<p>But for me two specific points from Keyes stuck out to me:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>At about 16:20 in the YouTube video he talks about the notion of “intuition” and “taste,” citing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvald</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 25:50 Keyes talks about how if you’ve <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2015/02/18/text-file-preferences.html">edited your vimrc file</a>– even just to add a custom key mapping, you’re effectively a plug-in author. I think it’s smart to erase the somewhat artificial line between those who package their vimscript functions and key mappings into plug-ins and someone who just adds their own key mappings and vimscript functions to their vimrc files.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For example, I’m super-satisfied with <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2015/08/02/markdwon-hyperlink-remap-for-vim.html">my little Markdown keymap</a> that I wrote the other day, and I’d be happy to offer it to others who had the same problem/need as I did when I wrote it. And of course, I’d be excited to see how they’d improve it.</p>

<p>By the way, here are <a href="https://github.com/neovim/homebrew-neovim/blob/master/README.md">the instructions I followed to install Neovim</a> on my machine using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Apparently it’s pretty stable as of this summer.</p>

<p>Note that when you install (via Homebrew at least), in the console window it gives you two suggested commands for linking your current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vimrc</code> file and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vim</code> directory to where Neovim will look for these files, and it worked like clockwork for me. Here they are:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The Neovim executable is called 'nvim'. To use your existing Vim
configuration:
    ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.nvimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim ~/.nvim
See ':help nvim' for more information on Neovim.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But for now I’m still going steady with <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2015/08/07/from-terminal-vim-to-mac-vim.html">MacVim</a>.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em></p>

<p>Due to <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/6b4063fafe5401b95d1f35ecb7f8dfe0079b7450">a recent change to Neovim’s master branch</a>, the above symlinks are no longer correct.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/3qgsza/psa_if_neovim_stopped_loading_your_nvimrc_after/">this Reddit thread</a>, which points to <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/78">issue #78</a>, for more information.</p>

<p>Here are the new symlinks I ran. They seem to have brought everything back to normal.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
ln -s ~/.vim ~/.config/nvim
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Interesting that they’d push such a significant change to master. Guess that’s part of the thrill of using pre-release software!</p>
