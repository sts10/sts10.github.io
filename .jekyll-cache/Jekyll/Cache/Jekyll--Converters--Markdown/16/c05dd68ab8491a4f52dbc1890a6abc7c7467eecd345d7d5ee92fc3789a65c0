I"<p>For <a href="http://get-xp.herokuapp.com/">xp</a> (<a href="https://github.com/kronosapiens/xp">GitHub Repo</a>), our skillshare-like web app for the Flatiron community, Daniel and I knew that we had to make it easy for students and teachers to coordinate lesson logistics. They would need a place and a way to hash out details like what a lesson would cover, where and when it would meet, how long it would last, etc. One way I thought we could do this is to give users the ability to comment on individual lessons.</p>
