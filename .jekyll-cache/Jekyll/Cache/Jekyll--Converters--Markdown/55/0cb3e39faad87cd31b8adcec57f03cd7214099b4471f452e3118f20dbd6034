I"»<p>I was browsing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sts10/m/vim_multi">my vim multireddit</a> today and, a few turns down a rabbit hole, found a Chrome Extension called <a href="https://vimium.github.io">Vimium</a>. Itâ€™s purpose is to provide Vim-like keyboard shortcuts for navigating the web. Here is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">the link to the Chrome Store page</a>.</p>
