I"<p>If you’re like me you’ve got a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">time-based one-time passwords</a> (aka “TOTP”) in a smartphone app like Google Authenticator. This system works pretty well: The service presents you with a QR code, you scan it with Google Authenticator, and then every 30 seconds you get a fresh 6-digit code to use as your second factor when logging in to the service. It’s more secure than using SMS for reasons I won’t spell out here.</p>
