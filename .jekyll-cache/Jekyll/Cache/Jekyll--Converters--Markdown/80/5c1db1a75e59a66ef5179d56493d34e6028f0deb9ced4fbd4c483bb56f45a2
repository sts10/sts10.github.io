I"à<p>For practice with Ruby and Rspec, Iâ€™ve been working through some Project Euler problems. One of my favorites so far is <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=9">#9</a>, which asks us to find the one Pythagorean triplet for which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a + b + c == 1000</code>. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/sts10/project_euler_num_9">GitHub repo with my solution</a> for you to look at while you read long, if youâ€™re into that.</p>
