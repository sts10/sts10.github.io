From experience I know that since by default OS X saves screenshotted images to your Desktop, they often contribute to Desktop clutter.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve written about <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2014/12/06/screenshots-mouse-trick.html">how I take screenshots before</a>, but just to be thorough, I thought Iâ€™d write my own version of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/quickly-change-os-xs-default-screenshot-format-and-loc-1489014578">this insightful Lifehacker post on how to change OS Xâ€™s default screenshot format and location</a>.</p>

<p>OK, letâ€™s get to it.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re going to set it up so that your screenshotted images (that you take with Shift + Command + 4) get saved to a folder on your Desktop called screenshots.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open an application called Terminal. It is located in Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/x4g4joq854vglm1/2015-05-28%20at%208.08%20PM.png" alt="Where Terminal is" /></p>

<p><strong>This Seems Scaryâ€¦</strong></p>

<p>Terminal gives you access to your computerâ€™s command line, where you can do all sorts of cool stuff. Basically you type or paste text commands, then hit enter, and your computer executes the command. But if youâ€™ve never used it before youâ€™re going to want to stick to these instructions closely.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Copy all of the following text to your clipboard as one line:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir ~/Desktop/screenshots; defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/screenshots; killall SystemUIServer</code></p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go back to Terminal and paste that text into the prompt (can use keyboard shortcut Command +v). Then hit enter.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Quit Terminal by going to Terminal &gt; Quit.</p>

<p>You should now be good to go! Test it out by taking a screenshot (Shift + Command + 4) and verifying that it gets saved to the new screenshots folder, rather than the desktop!</p>
