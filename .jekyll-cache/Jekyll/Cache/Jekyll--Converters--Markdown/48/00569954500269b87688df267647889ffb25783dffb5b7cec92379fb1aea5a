I"6<p>I’m excited about a community fork of <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> called <a href="https://keepassxc.org">KeePassXC</a>. They offer binary builds for the three major operating systems <a href="https://keepassxc.org/download">on their website</a>, however I wanted to build it from source for two reasons: (1) I was a little dubious of KeePassHTTP, which the developers are now building into the pre-built binaries (it appears to be disabled by default, but they have <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc#note-about-keepasshttp">a warning in the README</a>), and (2) I simply wanted the latest version, which already sports some UI improvements from the last time they made the binaries. Plus, to my knowledge, I’ve never built a real application from the source code before.</p>
