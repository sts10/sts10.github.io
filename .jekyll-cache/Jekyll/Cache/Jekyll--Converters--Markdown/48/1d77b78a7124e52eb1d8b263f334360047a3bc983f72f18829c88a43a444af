I"É<p>Last week I watched most of the videos in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8tzorAO7s0jy7DQ3Q0FwF3BnXGQnDirs">this YouTube playlist of Vim meetups from Thoughtbot</a>. One of the more revelatory for me was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhwtnCaFTFk&amp;list=PL8tzorAO7s0jy7DQ3Q0FwF3BnXGQnDirs&amp;index=7">one from John Crepezzi</a> in which he simply goes over how he uses Vim, with an emphasis on the plugins that he uses.</p>
