I"©<p>Iâ€™ve been thinking about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Information-Theory-Symbols-Mathematics/dp/0486240614/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525486758&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=john+R.+Pierce">information theory</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sts10/bits-to-die">entropy</a>, and passphrases for a couple of months now. Iâ€™ve been particularly interested in using random passphrases as passwords. An example of one of these passphrases would be â€œstamina turret backlands rubyâ€. The words have to be as purely random as possible â€“ using your four dogsâ€™ names is not nearly as strong as a password, as an attacker would likely guess that relatively early.</p>
