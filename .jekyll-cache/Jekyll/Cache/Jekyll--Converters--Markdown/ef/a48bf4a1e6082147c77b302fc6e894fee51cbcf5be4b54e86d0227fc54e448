I"ñ<p>A couple of weeks ago I was <a href="https://twitter.com/sts10/status/839933857679949829">proud of myself for switching from RVM to rbenv</a>. The reason I made the switch was that I wanted something light-weight and I didn‚Äôt like the RVM installation process, in particular the need to use the GPG command line tool.</p>

<p>The problem was that after I installed a fresh copy of Ruby 2.4.0 with rbenv, I wasn‚Äôt able to deploy this blog using my very old version of Octopress. I got an error that some specific version of a gem was not available. The gem that it couldn‚Äôt find must have been a dependency of one of the other gems. Anyway, I wsa stuck, unable to update my blog. I had been meaning to move off of Octopress anyway, since it had been so long since I set it up I was worried that if I moved to a new computer I‚Äôd be stuck. This gem problem was as good an impetus as any. (Though note I believe there is <a href="https://github.com/octopress/octopress">a newer version of Octopress</a> out there.)</p>

<p>After not doing any research (which is unlike me) and sending <a href="https://twitter.com/sts10/status/846463935184355328">a random call out tweet</a>, I decided on <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. The only way I had heard of it was because <a href="https://ricochet.im/">the Ricochet IM site</a> uses it. I like those developers, so I figured they had chosen a good, new static site generator. Plus it‚Äôs written in GoLang so it must be good, right? So earlier tonight I dove into <a href="https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/">the docs</a>.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre thinking about making the transition from Octopress to Hugo, you may want to checkout <a href="https://github.com/codebrane/octohug">octohug</a>. I ended up doing it by hand / Vim macros.</p>

<p>For now I‚Äôm using the <a href="http://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/">Beautiful Hugo</a> theme‚Ä¶ think it looks pretty good! Unfortunately the URL structure is different than when I used Octopess, so any and all external and even internal links are going to be busted. I‚Äôll try to fix them as I find them. I also decided to wipe my tag data cuz I was lazy making the transition. The only thing left to do is to add Disqus comments.</p>

<p>For posterity, here are some notes I took when I made the move:</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-hugo-blog">Setting Up the Hugo Blog</h2>

<p>I went <a href="https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/">here</a> and followed the instructions under ‚ÄúHosting Personal/Organization Pages‚Äù.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Delete sts10.github.io repo from Github</li>
  <li>Create on Github ‚Äúblog-hugo‚Äù repo. This is going to be the larger repo, aka the Hugo home directory. Add remote to current blog-hugo directory.</li>
  <li>Preview it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hugo server</code>.</li>
  <li>In my reading of the instructions linked to above, I thought I was supposed to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm -rf public</code> at this point, but that ended up derailing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git submodule</code> step for me?</li>
  <li>Create on Github ‚Äústs10.github.io‚Äù repo</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git submodule add -b master git@github.com:sts10/sts10.github.io.git public</code></li>
  <li>Set up the suggested <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deploy.sh</code> script, adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-t</code> flag and your chosen theme.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./deploy.sh "Your optional commit message"</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-post">Creating a New Post</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hugo new post/good-to-great.md</code></p>

<p>Then go open the file and edit it in your preferred text editor.</p>

<h2 id="preview-changes-new-posts">Preview Changes/ New Posts</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hugo server</code></p>

<h2 id="deploying-new-blog">Deploying new blog</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/.deploy.sh</code></p>

<p>Then, optionally, commit and push the home (bigger) repo.</p>
