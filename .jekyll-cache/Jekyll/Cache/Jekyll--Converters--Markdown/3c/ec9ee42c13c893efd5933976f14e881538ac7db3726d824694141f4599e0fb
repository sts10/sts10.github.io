I"∫B<p>Since 2012-ish I‚Äôve been using Sublime Text 2 as my primary text editor. It‚Äôs very simple out of the box, but also allows for a fair amount of customization through its packages, settings, snippets, and custom keybindings. I‚Äôve written about <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2014/03/01/some-sublime-text-tips-and-tricks.html">how I use Sublime Text</a> before, and I still think it‚Äôs a super powerful editor.</p>

<p>However after meeting and talking to some Emacs and Vim users, I figured I should at least explore those two options. First, I looked into Emacs.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="emacs">Emacs</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs a lot to say about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a>: it‚Äôs written in or runs on a programming language called Lisp, the original version started to be developed in 1976, it‚Äôs still very much in use today, etc.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the word ‚ÄúEmacs‚Äù actually refers to a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù of text editors, connected at least by a protocol that uses the control key for navigation and shortcuts. Some implementations of Emacs run in your terminal, while others you can download and install as stand-alone applications. The users I met used it in their terminal (either OS X‚Äôs Terminal application or <a href="http://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>), so that‚Äôs what I wanted to try first.</p>

<p>So I booted up Terminal and, figuring it came with my Macbook, typed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emacs</code> and, lo and behold, a program opened in the terminal window. Emacs uses the control key for basically everything, including basic navigation that the arrow keys would usually be used for (control+f is right, control+b is left, control+b is up, and control+p is up).</p>

<p>I took some time to learn <a href="http://www.rgrjr.com/emacs/emacs_cheat.html">the basics</a> and after a few days the basic navigation and cut and paste (‚Äúkill‚Äù and ‚Äúyank‚Äù) started to sort of feel natural to me. I took some steps forward from there: I got into window management a little, I updated my version of emacs that ran in the terminal to GNU Emacs 24.3.1 in order to get better syntax highlighting (the version that came with my computer couldn‚Äôt highlight Ruby for example).</p>

<p>(I unfortunately don‚Äôt remember how I upgraded it but here‚Äôs <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">the GNU Emacs website</a> and here‚Äôs the alias I had to put in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.bash_profile</code> to make my terminal open the new version when I typed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emacs</code>):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>alias emacs="/usr/local/Cellar/emacs/24.3/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I even <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15435253/how-to-remap-the-caps-lock-key-to-control-in-os-x-10-8">switched my control and caps lock keys</a>, which was super helpful for Emacs but also other shortcuts that use control.</p>

<p>But after playing around with some small Ruby scripts it just didn‚Äôt take. I went back to Sublime, which, I learned has the basic emacs navigation commands built in (so for example Ctrl+f goes forward, Ctrl+b goes back), so I tried to use those and avoid the arrow keys when I used Sublime. But seeing as how spread out those keys are (and knowing the Vim alternative was more efficient) it didn‚Äôt feel like that much of an advantage. So I went back to Sublime, but I was still open to trying new things. (Oh and I totally kept the caps lock and control key switch‚Äì highly recommended even if you‚Äôre using Sublime Text.)</p>

<h2 id="flirting-with-vim-sublime-texts-vintage-package">Flirting with Vim: Sublime Text‚Äôs Vintage Package</h2>

<p>Upon returning to the safety of Sublime, I decided I wanted to be a bit more adventurous. So I went into my User setting and unignored the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html">‚ÄúVintage‚Äù package</a>. Sublime Text ships with a package called Vintage, which emulates Vim‚Äôs insert/command modes. By default it is ignored so first-time users don‚Äôt mistakenly get stuck in command mode. But once you remove it (or comment it out) from your ignored packages in your user settings, hitting Escape in Sublime will take you into a ‚Äúcommand mode‚Äù that emulates Vim‚Äôs command mode.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5ZYOmo0KuI">Jeffrey Way‚Äôs video tutorial on Vintage Mode</a>. He also goes over the basic vi navigation (h j k l) and some more vi basics.</p>

<p>So for a few days or weeks I kept using Sublime but tried not to use the arrow keys (i.e. tried to use it as if it was Vim). I know a programmer who uses this setup‚Äì Sublime Text 2 with Vintage mode enabled‚Äì so I figure it‚Äôs pretty legit. You still get all the good stuff in Sublime (like the awesome Cmd+d functionality), but you also get the cool, simple Vim commands like ‚Äúchange‚Äù and ‚Äúyank‚Äù.</p>

<p>Hoping this might be my new jam as well, I searched Google for some good additional keybindings or packages to use on top of the Vintage package. Rather than finding good tips, I came upon this Quora thread where a user asked <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-Sublime-Texts-vintage-mode-a-clever-way-to-learn-Vim">‚ÄúIs Sublime Text‚Äôs ‚Äúvintage mode‚Äù a clever way to learn Vim?‚Äù</a>.</p>

<p>I read Sandeep Shete‚Äôs answer, which concludes with the sentiment: ‚ÄúIf you want to learn Vim then I guess one-two weeks with Vintage mode in Sublime is enough to not make you feel lost in Vim. Staying with Vintage mode any longer won‚Äôt make you better at Vim anymore than you already would be.‚Äù Clearly there are parts of Vi/Vim that simply cannot be replicated in Sublime Text, and it seems logical that those are the very parts that make Vi/Vim such a powerful, time-saving editor.</p>

<p>So this past week and weekend, stuck in a programming rut, I decided to at least setup my Vi/Vim environment and see how it went.</p>

<h2 id="vivim">Vi/Vim</h2>

<p>First, I ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vi</code> in my terminal. I was greeted with a centered introductory screen that begins: ‚ÄúVIM - Vi IMproved version 7.3‚Äù.</p>

<p>Apparently ‚ÄúSince MacOS 10.3 the ‚Äòvi‚Äô program is actually a console version of Vim 6.2 or later.‚Äù That quote is from <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php#mac">the vim.org download page</a>. Therefore from now on in this blog post, in attempt to minimize confusion, I‚Äôm just going to use ‚ÄúVim‚Äù (as opposed to vi) to refer to the editor.</p>

<p>Apparently the current release of Vim is 7.4 but I chose not to try to upgrade my version, again figuring that jump from 7.3 to 7.4 was minor and that upgrading would be a complicated operation.</p>

<h2 id="actually-learning-vim">Actually Learning Vim</h2>

<p>Now I had to actually learn Vim for real. Derek Wyatt has <a href="http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/novice/#Welcome">a great series of online videos</a> that served as my proper introduction to Vim.</p>

<p>Obviously I could write out a bunch of Vim commands here but I don‚Äôt think that would be useful for you. I‚Äôd say my basic tips are (1) not to get flustered by visual mode and its 3 variants, (2) commands that start with a colon ‚Äò:‚Äô are like file level commands (save file, quit Vim, change a setting, etc.) and (3) these colon commands can be run on an individual file, or they can be pasted into your .vimrc to be made to run for every Vim file when it starts. But honestly you should just go through his videos.</p>

<p>Below, though, is more about how I setup my Vim environment.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-my-vim-environment">Setting Up My Vim Environment</h2>

<p>Right, so the disclaimer here is that I learned all of the following from the Internet in the last four days. So, you know, grain of salt. But it might help you get started. Note: I‚Äôm running OS X 10.9.4.</p>

<h3 id="the-vimrc-file">The .vimrc File</h3>

<p>All of your personal Vim configuration stuff goes into a file called .vimrc which should be located in your home directory, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.vimrc</code>. I‚Äôm not sure, but I may have had to create this file with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch ~/.vimrc</code>, but I‚Äôm not sure‚Äì it might have already been there.</p>

<p>The .vimrc file is like a combination of your Sublime Text 2 User Preferences and your User keybindings. This is where you‚Äôll set options like your tab width, default color scheme, and your line break preference, as well as your keybindings.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://github.com/sts10/terminal_and_vim_settings/blob/master/vimrc">my current .vimrc file</a> (Note that in the repo I removed the leading dot in the file name so I could push it to Git more easily). That might not be much help to you, so here‚Äôs Derek Wyatt‚Äôs <a href="http://derekwyatt.org/2009/08/20/the-vimrc-file.html">explanation of the vimrc file</a> and his recommendation for <a href="http://derekwyatt.org/2009/08/20/the-absolute-bare-minimum">an absolute bare minimum vimrc file</a>. Both are super helpful (for example <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>, by default is turned OFF!).</p>

<h3 id="a-custom-keybinding-of-note">A Custom Keybinding of Note</h3>

<p>So in standard Vim you hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> to enter Insert mode and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Escape</code> to exit Insert mode and return to Command mode. I found the escape key to be a bit of a reach for me, plus on my Macbook Air keyboard it‚Äôs physically pretty small. So I pasted a custom keybinding into my .vimrc file to make a quick double-tap of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> exit Insert mode. Here‚Äôs the line:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imap ii &lt;Esc&gt;</code></p>

<p>However this binding does have a few draw backs, namely if you want to type 2 i‚Äôs quickly in your text, and there‚Äôs obviously a bit of a delay before i‚Äôs appear on the screen. But also, slightly more seriously, if you ever want to paste text that had two i‚Äôs next to each other from the system clipboard into Vim, Vim freaks out and exits Insert mode. I‚Äôm still weighing whether this is a problem large enough for me to change the keybinding.</p>

<h3 id="pathogen-and-nerdtree">Pathogen and NERDTree</h3>

<p>Next I wanted to add a sidebar to manage multiple files in multiple windows (like in Sublime Text). To do this I decided to install the <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NERDTree plugin</a>. However, as you‚Äôll notice in the installation section of NERDTree‚Äôs readme on Github, it recommends using something called pathogen.vim. <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> is apparently the go-to package/plugin manager for Vim, and installing it is delightfully easy. After installing it I added the line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execute pathogen#infect()</code> to my .vimrc file as instructed in the Pathogen readme.</p>

<p>After reading the NERDTree readme I also decided to paste these two lines to my .vimrc file as well:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>" Control + n to toggle NERDTree sidebar
map &lt;C-n&gt; :NERDTreeToggle&lt;CR&gt;

" Allows you to quit Vim if the only window left open is a NERDTree (https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) 
autocmd bufenter * if (winnr("$") == 1 &amp;&amp; exists("b:NERDTreeType") &amp;&amp; b:NERDTreeType == "primary") | q | endif
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So now Control+n opens the NERDTree sidebar, and Vim closes if the NERDTree sidebar is the only window left.</p>

<p>NERDTree has been working really well. You navigate to it like any other window (control+w then the direction to the window), then use j and k to navigate between the files in the directory. I open files with either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code>, depending if I want the new files to split the current window configuration vertically or horizontally (for more on window management in Vim, checkout Derek Wyatt‚Äôs section on <a href="http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/novice/#Many_Files_3">Working with Many Files (Screencast 3)</a>).</p>

<p>NERDTree also has allowed me to not have to deal with the Vim buffer, which, when I watched the Wyatt video covering it, seemed cool but un-Sublime like to me. Honestly I‚Äôm glad I can seemingly avoid learning its ins and outs for now.</p>

<h3 id="color-schemes">Color Schemes</h3>

<p>Of course you can just roll with your terminal colors and the default Vim syntax highlighting. But I knew that if I actually wanted to use Vim instead of Sublime to code, I‚Äôd have to make it look and feel like <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2014/02/14/my-current-coding-setup.html">my Sublime Text</a>. I set my Terminal font-face to <a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download">DejaVu Sans Mono</a>, so that my Vim running in Terminal would also use it. But I also needed to get the colors right to emulate my favorite Sublime theme, <a href="http://devthemez.com/themes/mustard">Mustard</a>.</p>

<p>I had a tough time figuring out how color schemes work in Vim. Part of my confusion stems from the fact that some color schemes you can download for Vim require your terminal have access to 256 colors rather than the usual 16.</p>

<p>Remember, I‚Äôm choosing to run Vim through the OS X‚Äôs Terminal app, which I believe can only ever handle 16 colors. You can run Vim with 256 colors by downloading and running <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>, but I just didn‚Äôt want to do that (note that MacVim is also known as Cocoa Gui, or gvim. More info <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php#mac">here</a>).</p>

<p>Further adding to my confusion was <a href="http://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>‚Äôs promise of being able to run Vim with 256 colors‚Äì I just could not get that to work as expected. Maybe you‚Äôll have more luck. UPDATE: To get this feature, even as of December 2015, <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2015/10/24/true-hex-colors-with-neovim-and-iterm2.html">you need to use iTerm2‚Äôs Nightly build</a> and probably use Neovim.</p>

<p>Thankfully the basic methodology for installing and loading a colorscheme seems to be the same no matter if you‚Äôre using Terminal, iTerm, or MacVim. You simply mkdir a directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.vim/colors</code> and then you drop special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vim</code> files in there. Once there in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">colors</code> directory, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:colorscheme colorschemename</code> in your vim buffer or, to set the default color scheme, just put that same line your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vimrc</code> file.</p>

<p>I needed some base16 Vim color schemes and I eventually found <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim">this git repo</a> that claimed to be full of them, but when I loaded them their colors were off. This was probably due to the fact that I had modified the 16 ANSI colors in my Terminal preferences to suit <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2014/02/05/flatiron-day-two.html">my Terminal setup</a>.</p>

<p>So I set out to make my own base16 color scheme, based off the one I‚Äôve been using in Sublime Text for months, which is called <a href="http://devthemez.com/themes/mustard">Mustard</a>. It took me a few hours to figure what color affected what part of Ruby, Python, and HTML code, but I ended up with a pretty good match‚Äì <a href="https://github.com/sts10/terminal_and_vim_settings/blob/master/mustard.vim">here‚Äôs the mustard.vim file I created</a>.</p>

<p>If you actually want to use my colorscheme, you should know 2 things: (1) as it says on line 2 of the file, you need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:set background=dark</code> to get the colors I picked to emulate the original Mustard theme.</p>

<p>And (2) note that to get the alterations to the 16 default Terminal colors necessary to make it actually look like the Mustard Sublime theme, you may have to load <a href="https://github.com/sts10/terminal_and_vim_settings/blob/master/sts_sep_2014.terminal">my Terminal settings</a> as well (note: these setting cannot be loaded into iTerm2, only OS X‚Äôs Terminal app).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well that‚Äôs about it for now. I know this ran pretty long, as usual. I typed this in Vim though, so it was good practice! No promises if I‚Äôll use Vim for coding going forward, but every day it‚Äôs starting to feel more natural.</p>
