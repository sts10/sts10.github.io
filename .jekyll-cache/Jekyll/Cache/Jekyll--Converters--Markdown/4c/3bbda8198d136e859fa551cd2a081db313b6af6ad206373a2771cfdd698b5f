I"1<p>I’ve got two days of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018">Advent of Code 2018</a> under my belt and four stars to show for it! But I’ll be the first to admit that I had plenty of help, so I thought it only fair that I write out some of the things I’ve <em>already</em> learned about Rust.</p>
