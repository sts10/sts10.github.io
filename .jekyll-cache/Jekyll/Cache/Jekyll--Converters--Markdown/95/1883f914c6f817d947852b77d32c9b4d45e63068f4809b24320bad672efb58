I"æ<p>This past week I got the feeling that I hadnâ€™t really given myself any programming challenges in a while. I had also been thinking about trying a statically typed, compiled language for a few weeks. I had C++ in mind, mostly because I actually wrote some in my high school AP Computer Science class, and <a href="https://www.keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>, an application I use to store my passwords, is <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc">written in C++</a>.</p>
