I"<p>Three months ago I <a href="https://medium.com/adventures-in-consumer-technology/my-latest-obsession-mechanical-keyboards-ef9e28089327">wrote a post on Medium</a> about how I had gotten pretty deep into the world of mechanical keyboards. Over the course of my post, after explaining some of the benefits (as I understood them at the time) and a brief explanation of the key things to look for in a keyboard, I shared that I had ended up purchasing a KUL ES-87 Cherry MX Brown TKL keyboard (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/ES-87-Tenkeyless-Mechanical-Keyboard-Cherry/dp/B00KI1ZAHY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411184774&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kul+87+brown">Amazon link, where I bought it from</a>, <a href="http://www.keyeduplabs.com/es-87.html">KUL product page</a>).</p>
