I"¥<p>Iâ€™ve joined <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/">totallynuclear.club</a>, a shared UNIX serve similar to Paul Fordâ€™s <a href="http://tilde.club/">tilde club</a> (read more about <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">how tilde club got started</a>).</p>

<p>On totallynuclear Iâ€™m <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~schlink">~schlink</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m in the process of building a basic blog CMS using Ruby and ERB for these types of sites. Iâ€™m calling it <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation/">Radiation</a>, and I just pushed out version 0.1.0 (Iâ€™m going by a pretty arbitrary version numbering system).</p>

<p>I might write up a nice long post about my process writing Radiation here, but so far Iâ€™ve being using Radiation itself to blog about my progress. <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~schlink">Hereâ€™s that blog</a>.</p>
