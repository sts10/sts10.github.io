I"û<p>When I started using Vim the first plugin I downloaded was <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NERDTree</a>, a sidebar file explorer similar to what the text editor I was leaving, Sublime Text, had. It was a good crutch to get me into managing multiple files in Vim, but as I get more comfortable in Vim I‚Äôm running into a problem detailed in <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/">this Vimcasts blog post</a>, namely that when you open or split a new file from NERDTree, it is difficult to predict where the new window will open.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>What you want instead is a way to call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edit</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">split</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vsplit</code> (shortcutted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sp</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vs</code>) first, then get a directory in the window that will shortly be replaced by whatever file you chose to open or create.</p>

<p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfyXKnQ9kAQ&amp;list=PL8tzorAO7s0jy7DQ3Q0FwF3BnXGQnDirs&amp;index=6">a YouTube video</a> today and learned about netrw, Vim‚Äôs ‚Äúdefault‚Äù file explorer, which apparently does exactly what I describe above.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pi_netrw.html">netrw documentation</a> is pretty good. Important functionality includes: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> to create a new file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code> to create a new directory, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;c-l&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:e.</code> to refresh the directory, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> to go up a directory.</p>

<p>While I have adopted the style and philosophy of netrw over that those of NERDTree, I do have two lighter-weight plugins that help me out. The first is one created by Time Pope called <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar">Vinegar</a> which adds some lightweight improvements to netrw.</p>

<p>The second, and more intrusive, is <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a>, a fuzzy file finder. I have three keymappings in my vimrc associated with ctrlp:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>" Ctrl- P mapping and two custom split keymappings (https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)
let g:ctrlp_map = '&lt;c-p&gt;'
nmap &lt;c-n&gt;s :split&lt;CR&gt;&lt;c-w&gt;j&lt;c-p&gt;
nmap &lt;c-n&gt;v :vsplit&lt;CR&gt;&lt;c-w&gt;l&lt;c-p&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus I have un-installed NERDTree and have been using ctrlp and Vinegar. We‚Äôll see how it goes.</p>
