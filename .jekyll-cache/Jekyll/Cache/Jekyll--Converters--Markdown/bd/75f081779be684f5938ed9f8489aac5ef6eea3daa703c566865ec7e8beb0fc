I"‹<p><em>This post has been re-published from <a href="http://schlinkblog.tumblr.com/post/74943612048/a-social-media-editor-begins-learning-to-code-or-my">my personal Tumblr</a> with some edits</em>.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, January 8th I packed up my things and left my first real job.</p>

<p>Two years earlier I had <a href="http://newsweek.tumblr.com/post/10690131520/hey-we-hired-an-intern">started as an intern</a> at <em>Newsweek</em> &amp; The Daily Beast, eventually becoming the deputy social media editor. 28 months and tens of thousands of tweets later, I willingly sent in my resignation letter.</p>

<p>A few days later I had already un-followed nearly 200 accounts on Twitter, disconnected The Daily Beast‚Äôs official Twitter accounts from my phone and my TweetDeck, and cleaned up my Chrome Bookmark Bar. I‚Äôd be lying if I said I hadn‚Äôt been looking forward to this digital cleanse (sorry to all you horse-race political reporters who have one fewer follower).</p>

<p>Working at <em>Newsweek</em> &amp; The Daily Beast was an incredible experience, especially during the 2012 election, and I am unquestionably a smarter, stronger person than I was when I left my parents house to go to that interview in 2011.</p>

<p>But in some ways it feels like I‚Äôm leaving at a time when the future of the ‚Äúsocial media editor‚Äù at news websites seems uncertain. As more and more reporters and editors join and learn to use Twitter, writing good tweets and Facebook updates will become less of a valuable skill. Covering breaking news live with social media tools will also become a more common skill (or at least it will at successful publishers).</p>

<p>Also, as Facebook referrals become a higher percentage of total site traffic, editors are becoming more dependent on Facebook‚Äôs Newsfeed algorithm: essentially a blackbox of code that determines what appears in users‚Äô feeds whose whims social media editors can only guess at. (To get an idea of how sensitive some publishers are to the algorithm, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/publishers-nervously-await-the-facebook-correction">read Charlie Warzel‚Äôs piece about how worried they are about whether or not a recent boost in Facebook referrals will soon end</a>.) Not to mention that social media editors have little to do with <em>organic</em> social referrals‚Äì i.e. people who come to the publisher‚Äôs site via a friend‚Äôs post on Facebook or Twitter, rather than one posted from one of the organization‚Äôs accounts.</p>

<p>I still think Twitter is fun, but some folks say it‚Äôs becoming <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/valley-of-the-blahs-how-justin-biebers-downfall-exposed-twitters-achilles-heel/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">less of a new source and more of a crappy cocktail party</a>.</p>

<p>Journalism in general seems to be going through some rather unsightly growing pains as it continues to adapt to new technology available to both journalists and readers. Without a universal metric for ‚Äúengagement,‚Äù editors will keep chase page-views because that‚Äôs what advertisers want to see. Content management systems (CMSs) continue to be years behind the current needs of most organizations, meanwhile the ever-multiplying Upworthys, Viral Novas, and other narrative-porn-pushers of the web are making Buzzfeed‚Äôs listicles seem respectable. Not to say there‚Äôs no <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/01/the-newsonomics-of-why-everyone-seems-to-be-starting-a-news-site/">hope</a> for news online. But for now I‚Äôm taking a break.</p>

<p>So what is next for me? As I tweeted earlier this month, I will be attending the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a> in Manhattan this spring to learn how to code. I want to make things that are more permanent than a tweet or Tumblr post or even an online news article.</p>

<p>The 12-week web development course focuses on a programming language called Ruby and one of its associated web frameworks, Ruby on Rails. While I‚Äôve used HTML, CSS, and Javascript before, including at The Daily Beast, Ruby will be completely new to me. (For a fun, non-technical introduction, check out [Annie Lowrey on the disappearance of <em>why](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers</em>.html).)</p>

<p>The class itself doesn‚Äôt start until February 3rd, so this month I‚Äôve been working my way through what Flatiron calls <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com/web-development/">‚Äúpre-work‚Äù</a>: some basic foundational work, from HTML to Git to basic Ruby and Rails, that will help everyone be on more-or-less the same page come day one. It‚Äôs nice to work on my own schedule again‚Äì I‚Äôve been naturally sleeping in and staying up pretty late. At first I was a little anxious about this, but I quickly learned to embrace a college-like work/sleep schedule.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs this ‚Äúpre-work‚Äù like so far? It‚Äôs been a lot of advanced CSS and, more recently, an introduction to Ruby (I‚Äôll be drilling in a basic Git workflow and hopefully setting up Rails this upcoming week). For the Treehouse and Code School courses that Flatiron recommends, it‚Äôs watching short videos and then taking little quizzes (both services are about $25 per month for all-you-watch). Code Academy‚Äôs lessons (which are free!) are just text and coding exercises.</p>

<p>When I need a break I try to see people in real life (<a href="http://thebillfold.com/2013/11/tips-for-the-suddenly-unemployed-from-the-recently-suddenly-unemployed/">rules are important</a>). I‚Äôve read <a href="http://schlinkblog.tumblr.com/post/74806974593/recent-longreads-of-note-work-why-the-ideal">a few books</a>. I played Gears of War 2 from beginning to end over three weekdays. When I‚Äôm not watching instructional videos, I‚Äôve found that Grateful Dead has been a pleasant, don‚Äôt-freak-out coding soundtrack for me. From time to time I check Twitter, a community I interacted with almost constantly for two years, to get a feel for what‚Äôs going on. But generally, for the first time in two years, I‚Äôve kept TweetDeck closed, unconcerned with keeping track of all of Twitter‚Äôs wonderful inside jokes, or being up-to-speed on what today‚Äôs big outrage is.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been nice.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll try to blog more going forward‚Äì the school encourages it. Not sure if I‚Äôll stick with this Tumblr, or even the Tumblr platform I once loved so much. Whatever I decide, I‚Äôll be sure to let you know.</p>
