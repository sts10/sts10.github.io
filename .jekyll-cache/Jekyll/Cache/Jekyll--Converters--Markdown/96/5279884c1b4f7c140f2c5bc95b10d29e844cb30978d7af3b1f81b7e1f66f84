I"§<p>On my work computer Iâ€™ve been having some trouble getting the 2015 MacBook Proâ€™s Terminal Vim to access the system clipboard. There is a chance that the version of Vim that shipped with the computer does not support the feature in which the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> register is connected to the system clipboard. (Iâ€™ll note the version number next time Iâ€™m in the office.)</p>
