I"K<p>This week I finished the most recent book in <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/categories/books/">my self-guided study of 20th century technology</a>, namely <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442262743&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ideas+factory"><em>The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation</em></a>, by Jon Gertner. As the title implies, itâ€™s a chronicle of research and development wing of AT&amp;T, a history that lasts roughly from the 1920s to its demise in the 1980s.</p>
