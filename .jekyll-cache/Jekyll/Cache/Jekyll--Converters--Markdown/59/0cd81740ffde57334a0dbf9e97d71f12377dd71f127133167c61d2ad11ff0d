I"ý<p>Having read three more of <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2016/02/14/bowie-books.html">David Bowieâ€™s favorite books</a>, I thought itâ€™d be nice to write a little. The three books, the plots of which, unintentional on my part at least, had something to do with the far left, were <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0375714790/ref=sr_rp_1?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458698414&amp;sr=sr-1&amp;keywords=The+Leopard%3A+A+Novel"><em>The Leopard</em> by Di Lampedusa</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Darkness-at-Noon-Arthur-Koestler/dp/1416540261/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458698450&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=darkness+at+noon+by+arthur+koestler"><em>Darkness at Noon</em> by Koestler</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/42nd-Parallel-U-S-Trilogy/dp/0618056815/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458698558&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+42nd+parallel+by+john+dos+passos"><em>The 42nd Parallel</em> by dos Passos</a>. I figured itâ€™d be good to put some notes down while theyâ€™re fresh.</p>
