I"Å<p>In my most-recent post I wrote about <a href="http://sts10.github.io/2014/03/01/some-sublime-text-tips-and-tricks.html">some Sublime Text tips and tricks</a> I had picked up from an instructional video. I‚Äôve since been using these new techniques almost constantly, especially the window management keyboard shortcuts (set via Sublime‚Äôs key-bindings). I‚Äôve found them to be super-helpful, especially as we moved into Sinatra and now Ruby on Rails, which involves projects with many files. Naturally, I began to explore ways in which I could set keyboard shortcuts to manage the windows of all my programs, not just Sublime Text.</p>
