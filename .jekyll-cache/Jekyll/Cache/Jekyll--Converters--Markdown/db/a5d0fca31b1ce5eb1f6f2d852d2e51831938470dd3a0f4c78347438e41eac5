I"›<p>Last week I attended a class on basic digital security at the BuzzFeed office, which included some basic encryption techniques. Before the class I knew nothing about how PGP encryption works, but now that Iâ€™ve got a bit of a handle on it I figured Iâ€™d lay down what I know so far here. Iâ€™m going to err on the side of practical rather than philosophical here, since that was the gist of the class.</p>
