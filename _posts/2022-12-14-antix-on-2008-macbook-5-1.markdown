I was visiting family this past weekend and saw an iMac from 2007 and MacBook (2008) destined for the trash. As the tech nerd of the family, I was asked if these machines were still useful at all.

As you might expect, neither of these machines can run a version of mac OS that is currently supported by Apple. 

The iMac is an iMac5,1, which apparently can only be upgraded to 10.7.5 Lion ([source](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6584536)), which stopped getting support years ago. It has 1 GB of RAM.

I _think_, based on serial number, the MacBook is a MacBook5,1, which [apparently can run to OS X 10.11 El Capitan](https://igotoffer.com/apple/macbook-5#Specifications), but even that is also no longer supported.

## A note on securely erasing old data

For a variety of reasons, including my own laziness, I didn't worry too much about securely erasing the existing data on these particular computers. That was probably a mistake. I think both machines have rotating drives (HDDs), which are easier to erase securely than the more modern solid state drives, though I don't have enough confidence to point you to a resource, other than maybe [ShredOS](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64) (which I kind of want to use just for the experience).

If I do end up either donating or trashing them, I may take steps to more securely erase everything on them, hopefully effectively securely deleting everything that's _ever_ been on them.

Note: If you need to wipe a computer with a solid-state drive, I'd point you to [this guide](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/how-to-securely-wipe-your-computer-devices/).

## A lightweight Linux distro? 

So, with no support from Apple, I looked to my favorite OS, Linux. Given that the iMac has only 1 GB of RAM and the Macbook has 2 GB, I knew I needed a lightweight Linux distribution (aka "distro").

In a past situations like this I have [used Lubuntu](https://sts10.github.io//2016/11/08/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html) and [Puppy Linux](https://sts10.github.io//2022/08/23/reviving-a-thinkpad-x40.html), but  figured I should look around for something new to me and maybe more challenging. (Plus Lubunutu felt too heavy for 1 GB of RAM.)

Ultimately I found [antiX Linux](https://antixlinux.com/), which is based on Debian (awesome), and recently [published a new release called, logically, antiX-22](https://antixlinux.com/antix-22-released/) based on [Debian bullseye](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/).

## The iMac

I started with the iMac. (I think [these are roughly the correct specs](https://igotoffer.com/apple/imac-core-2-duo-2-16-20-inch).)

Step 1: I needed to find out it had a 64-bit processor or a 32-bit one, so that I could attempt to install the corresponding version of antiX (which is available in both, slightly rare for Linux distros these days). 

[It turns out that iMac5,1s have a 64-bit processor, BUT "it has a 32-bit EFI and is not capable of booting into 64-bit mode."](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6584536), which sounds like a real nightmare for someone facing the either/or choice of trying to install a 64- or 32-bit version of Linux. (In hindsight I would have been safe just to go with a 32-bit version.)

I decided to try the 64-bit first, figuring that it was preferable for finding software to install down the road.

I [downloaded](https://antixlinux.com/download/) the 64-bit "full" antiX Linux iso file from Sourceforge and flashed it onto a USB stick using Pop_OS's "USB Flasher" program (you can use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or something similar). My first goal was to try a live demo version of antiX to see how well it worked before installing it on to the computer hard drive.

With the USB stick and a keyboard plugged in, I turned on the iMac, pressing and holding down the Alt/Option key when I heard the familiar Apple start-up sound. I then clicked on the "EFI" boot option. 

I was greeted by the antiX boot screen loaded just fine. So far so good.

![antiX UEFI boot screen](/img/antix/bootscreen.jpg)

But when I chose to launch antiX I was taken to a black (but lit) screen. 

I had had some experience with this when [getting Ubuntu on to a 2009 MacBook Pro 5 years ago](https://sts10.github.io//2016/11/08/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html). I figured I needed to edit some GRUB settings. 

I rebooted and held option/alt again to get back to the antiX boot menu. At this point, I hit 'e' instead of enter in order to edit the GRUB parameters. To learn more about the cause of the black screen, I tried a few options I knew that might give me more information, like adding `nosplash`, `debug`, and removing `quiet`. Thanks to these changes, I found out that the boot was hanging while the text "Waiting for /dev to be fully populated" was displayed.

<!-- Adding `nomodeset nosplash` to the GRUB options got me to a command line, giving me a clue that the issue had to do with the video card in the machine. --> 

After [looking up other boot parameter options](https://download.tuxfamily.org/antix/docs-antiX-22/Boot_Menu/antiX-gfxboot.html#bo_antix) and a lot of trial and error, I finally added the `nosplash failsafe disable=lxF` parameters and antiX's GUI live demo booted. Success! However, I think the `failsafe` options tells antiX not to use the computer's *video card*, which negatively affects performance. But at this point I'm not sure of another way to make the GUI launch....

I think what I really need to do is to get the computer to use the correct AMD/Radeon driver (it has a AMD RV530/M56-P [Mobility Radeon X1600] graphic card), but as of this writing I'm not sure how to do that. 

Then, when I went to actually install antiX to this hard drive, I hit a new set of issues that I won't bother laying out here. 

So unfortunately, I'm leaving the iMac in a broken state. I would permanently run antiX from a USB stick in `failsafe` mode, but it's pretty sluggish. I'm considering loading [ShredOS](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64), wiping the hard drive as thoroughly as I can, and tossing it.

## The MacBook

![a MacBook5,1](/img/antix/macbook-5-1.png)

I had more success with the MacBook. (Here are what I think are [some accurate specs](https://igotoffer.com/apple/macbook-5).)

Using my same USB stick with antiX 22 full/64-bit flashed, I rebooted the Macbook, holding alt/option when I heard the boot-up sound. I selected the EFI and got to the now-familiar antiX boot screen. I hit 'e' to edit GRUB options and added `nosplash`, anticipating issues that I'd need information on, but the live demo GUI loaded right up! (Note that I don't think anmtiX is using the NVIDIA graphics card...)

Excited, I clicked the GUI installer. Unfortunately, I think I hit an error around 12% of the way through the installation: something about an error while attempting to format the internal hard drive (`/sda`). On a tip I found somewhere on the internet, I closed the installer and launched GParted, which is helpfully included in the antiX 22 live demo.

When you launch GParted in the antiX demo, it may ask for a system password. Apparently it's `demo` (or maybe `root`). 

Using GParted, I re-partitioned the hard drive to the following:
* `/dev/sda1` as the EFI partition. File system: fat 32; Mount Point: `/boot/efi`; Size: 256MB
* `/dev/sda2` as the root partition. File system: ext4; Mount Point: `/`; Label: `rootantix22`; Size: 48.3 GB (could likely get away with closer to 6GB, but I had plenty of storage to spare...)
* `/dev/sda3` as the swap partition. File system: `linux-swap`; Mount Point is blank(?); Label: `swapantix`; Size: 2.62 GB (think you want this to match size of system RAM? I gave it a bit extra just in case)
* `/dev/sda4` as the home partition. File system: `ext4`; Mount Point: `/home`; Label: `home`; Size: 181.7GB.

Then I clicked the check mark button at the top of GParted to have it do all this re-formatting, which took maybe 2 minutes. This had the bonus effect of deleting (maybe not very securely) the old data on the hard drive.

Once that was done, I relaunched the GUI antiX installer. I chose a custom install and, using drop-down menus, matched each partition with its assignment (root, swap, home, etc.). Once the installer was done, I rebooted the system and it launched right into antiX! Very cool.

### Troubleshooting (at this point)

If, with the USB stick removed, you reboot the computer and it takes you to a command line login, don't panic. Login in the credentials you set while installing antiX. 

Once the prompt says `<your_username>@<computername>`, run `suco nano /etc/default/grub` to edit GRUB setting. You'll likely want them to match the settings you used to get the demo running (in my case, `nosplash failsafe disable=lxF`). Save the changes to the file (`Ctrl-O`, then enter) and exit nano (`Ctrl-X`), then run `sudo update-grub` to make the changes to the actual GRUB config files. Finally, run `sudo reboot` to restart the computer.

Note that, while the USB live demo uses the "Legacy" kernel, the installed version will try to use the **latest** kernal included in the antiX iso. So if you still have issues with the installed version of antiX that you _didn't_ with the live USB demo, it might be because of the use of the newer kernel. Currently, I'm not sure how to change this...

### AntiX 

AntiX seems perfect for my needs. The default IceWM window manager is light but modern-looking. The stability of Debian and its familiar `apt` CLI tool is comforting. I loved the choice of many window managers, which ranged in their feel and resource usage (and it's wonderful that you can switch between them "live", with little delay). And [the user forum](https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/another-case-of-waiting-for-dev-to-be-fully-populated/) was super helpful when I had questions. 

I will note that the default UI (with the IceWM window manager) is definitely more Windows-inspired than Mac-inspired -- for example, a lot of user actions start with clicking the "antiX" button in the bottom left, a la the Windows "Start" button. While this is great for folks coming from (older versions of) Windows, I was a bit slow to get used to it. There are (of course) ways to make antiX look more like Mac OS (see [here](https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/how-to-make-antix-look-like-macos-with-jwm/) and [here](https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/make-antix-look-like-macos/)), e.g. I could have added a dock like [Plank](https://launchpad.net/plank), but I worried about increased RAM usage. Not a big deal.

I was also a bit confused about how to use antiX as a "live USB", by which I understand you load it onto a USB stick and carry it around to fire up on any computer you might have access to. As I understand it (a) this type of USB is distinct from just loading up the ISO on a USB stick (maybe since it includes persistence of storage and/or preferences), and (b) the best/easiest way to create one of these special "live" USBs is to use a normal antiX-flashed USB? It was a bit confusing to me. FWIW, [I encountered a similar confusion with Puppy Linux](https://sts10.github.io//2022/08/23/reviving-a-thinkpad-x40.html#installing-puppy-linux-to-the-hard-drive).

But in general I definitely recommend antiX! 

### RAM-saving tweaks

Next, in order to be able to do some multi-tasking on this 2 GB RAM laptop, I took the following steps:

1. AntiX specific: Run `sudo cp /usr/local/bin/zram /etc/init.d && sudo update-rc.d zram default` then reboot to enable zram at start-up. ([source](https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/making-a-pentium-4-laptop-useful-with-antix/))
2. AntiX comes with Firefox ESR as the default browser. While I support that choice generally, it felt a bit heavy for my purposes, so I used the included package manager to install [Pale Moon browser](https://www.palemoon.org/) and made it the default and preferred browser. (I tried [SeaMonkey](https://www.seamonkey-project.org/) first but it didn't play audio out of the box and I didn't feel like fixing that.)
3. In the antiX (Start) menu, go to Desktop and switch to Minimal-IceWM desktop environment (this change will occur immediately AND, I believe, automatically persist through reboots -- very nifty). Note that with the Minimal version of IceWM you do lose, among other things, the GUI volume control in the bottom left of the main task bar (this gives you an idea of just how minimal the window manager is). So that's a trade-off.

After taking these steps, with the default terminal open, running `free -m` informs that I have 131MB used. With Pale Moon open and playing a YouTube video, usage bumps up to 485MB. Impressive!

### Theming 

Given how often I was re-installing distros this weekend, I couldn't really bring myself to start working on a theme/aesthetic for the laptop (in case I had to soon after start over with a new installation or something). But I think that'd be a fun follow-up project.

The [antiX forum](https://www.antixforum.com) has some posts about looks, including [how to model it after macOS](https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/how-to-make-antix-look-like-macos-with-jwm/).

First, I want to try out the other built-in Desktops (window managers) to see if I like any more than Rox IceWM, starting with plain ol' "IceWM" (which I think is a choice).

As for themes and icons, [in the past](https://sts10.github.io/2017/04/18/xfce-and-other-linux-notes.html) I used the now-defunct Paper theme and icons for Xfce. This time around I might try [Papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme), [Flat Remix](https://github.com/daniruiz/flat-remix-gnome), or [We10X](https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/We10X-icon-theme). To be honest I'm not sure which of these general "Linux" themes (maybe they're GTK?) will work on antiX, but I figure it's worth a shot.

For a dock I might I've heard a lot about [Plank](https://github.com/ricotz/plank), but have also seen that it eats about 25 mb of RAM.

## Epilogue 

Brimming with confidence, I tried to install antiX on my old MacBook Pro 3,1, which was still running Ubuntu 16.04 from [this post](https://sts10.github.io//2016/11/08/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html). 

After a couple of failed boots and install attempts (the last of which was trying to use antiX 19.5 because apparently I could get the right Nvidia driver (legacy-340xx) with Debian Buster?), I seem to have **deleted GRUB**, which I think is recoverable, but seems like a pain. I just add this note to say that (a) I'm far from an expert, (b) antiX is not advertised as a beginner-friendly distro and now I know a bit more why that is.
