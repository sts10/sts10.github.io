I was browsing [my vim multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/sts10/m/vim_multi) today and, a few turns down a rabbit hole, found a Chrome Extension called [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io). It's purpose is to provide Vim-like keyboard shortcuts for navigating the web. Here is [the link to the Chrome Store page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb). 

The default key mappings are spelled out in [the GitHub repo's ReadMe](https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/README.md). However the scroll bindings and link opening commands seemed a bit much for me. Plus the tab navigation seems redundant to me, considering the Chrome already has good shortcuts for tab navigation (`Command + shift [` and `Command + <tab number>`, plus `Command + t`, `Command + w` and `Command + Shift + t` [reopen last closed tab]), all of which I've become trained to use.

But there are some tricks and functionality that Vimium genuinely adds to Google Chrome. By that I mean not only does it make functions you could do in default Chrome with a mouse accessible via keyboard shortcut (like pin tab), but it adds functions that, to my knowledge, users simply could not do in default Chrome (for example: search open tabs and close tabs to the left). These are the commands I was and am most interested in adding via this extension.

However I knew I probably didn't want to have a keyboard shortcut for _every_ Vimium command. I wanted to be able to pick and choose which mappings were enabled. Wonderfully, Vimium accepts custom key mappings in a nifty, simple text-field in the extension's options menu.

You can even clear all default mappings by starting with `unmapAll`. After that, users are free to specify only the mappings that they want. 

So here is my first stab at my custom key mappings:

```
unmapAll
map <a-p> togglePinTab
map <c-p> Vomnibar.activateTabSelection
map yy copyCurrentUrl
map yt duplicateTab
map vsÂ toggleViewSource
map / enterFindMode
map n performFind
map N performBackwardsFind
map <c-h> moveTabLeft
map <c-l> moveTabRight
map <a-h> closeTabsOnLeft
map <a-l> closeTabsOnRight
map ? showHelp
```

### Notable Mappings:

- `<a-p>` (meaning alt-p) pins current tab-- a shortcut I've always wanted. 
- `<c-p>` (control-p) searches your open tabs-- super awesome for users like me who often have a ton of tabs open at once. It's actually what seems like a fuzzy search, which is dope. (I chose control-p after [a Vim plugin I use called ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) that performs a similar operation in Vim.)
- `yt` - As with pin tab, I always wanted a keyboard shortcut for duplicating the current tab.
- the Find mode stuff is straight Vim-- I'm going to give it a try, since you can navigate to the next and previous matches straight from the keyboard.
- And lastly I have some commands to move tabs and close tabs to the left and right of the current tab. You can right-click a tab and choose to close tabs to the right of it, which is super useful. But now I can close to the left as well, and both without leaving the home row of the keyboard.

Again note, **search open tabs** and close tabs to left and  are new functions! Very cool!
