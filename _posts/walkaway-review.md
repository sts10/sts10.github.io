A few months ago I saw this tweet from Tim Carmody about Steve Jobs, the iPhone, and disability. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve written two good things about Jobs and the iPhone, and they&#39;re both about disability <a href="https://t.co/kXoocH7RW8">https://t.co/kXoocH7RW8</a><a href="https://t.co/phKbLcBnkn">https://t.co/phKbLcBnkn</a></p>&mdash; Tim Carmody (@tcarmody) <a href="https://twitter.com/tcarmody/status/818564895365099520">January 9, 2017</a></blockquote>

Both posts are both well-written and emotional. The one in Wired focuses on how the iPhone and related iDevices helped Carmody's son, who is on the autism spectrum:

> My son is on the autism spectrum and has a severe receptive and expressive language delay. He's 4 years old, and can read and spell words, and sing entire songs, but is more like an 18-month- or 2-year-old in normal conversation. He cannot use a telephone and has a hard time sitting still for video telephony. He has a thoroughly well-loved iPod Touch, filled with videos and apps that have helped him learn to speak and augment his ability to communicate.

The other piece, with the spectacular title ["Computers are for people"](http://kottke.org/13/09/computers-are-for-people), gets at the broader idea that I want to talk about: 

> Weâ€™re all disabled sometimes. If I turn off the lights in your room, you can't see. If I fill the room with enough noise, you can't hear. If your hands are full, you can't use them to do anything else.

> But as Sara Hendren writes, "all technology is assistive technology." When it's working right, technology helps people of every ability overcome these limitations. It doesn't throw us back into the world of assumptions that expects us all to be fully capable all of the time.

It is in this context-- that "all technology is assistive technology"-- that I want to talk about Cory Doctorow's new book, _Walkaway_, as well as myself. 

_Walkaway_ is set in the not-too-distant future, where society is largely dominated by the super rich. AS a reuslt of things becoming intolerable for the middle classes, a number people have simply decided to "walkaway" into the wilderness and make a new life there.

> Snowden pointed out that the book is a mirror version of Atlas Shrugged: instead of a few ubermensch bringing down a misguidedly egalitarian society by leaving, it's about a mass movement of the disenfranchised threatening a society controlled by the vastly wealthy. Or, as Doctorow put it, "This is the novel about all the people who, when Atlas shrugged, said 'Good riddance!'"

Technology has allowed me to do some amazing things. I was born with what became a diagnosis of mild cerebral palsy. I've been incredibly lucky. I remember using a computer as early as Kindergarten. In 5th grade (and maybe earlier?) I got access to the class computer whenever we had to write essays in class. I think it was a Mac and I used [Clarisworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleWorks#AppleWorks.2FClarisWorks_.28Macintosh.2FWindows_versions.2C_1991.E2.80.932004.29)?
