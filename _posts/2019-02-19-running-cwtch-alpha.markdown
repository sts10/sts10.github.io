This past Valentine's Day, [Open Privacy released an alpha build of an encrypted messaging app called Cwtch](https://openprivacy.ca/blog/2019/02/14/cwtch-alpha/).

You can read more about Cwtch either in [this blog post](https://openprivacy.ca/blog/2019/02/14/cwtch-alpha/) or [their main Gitlab repo](https://git.openprivacy.ca/cwtch.im/cwtch). But it's basically a decentralized chat application that uses end-to-end encryption for all communication. It also uses Tor Onion services to further protect the metadata of communication.

## Getting this Alpha release up and running on Ubuntu 18.04

Note: I'm running Kubutnu 18.04.

### 1. Download [pre-built Linux binary](https://git.openprivacy.ca/cwtch.im/ui/releases). 
### 2. Extract the downloaded zip file and navigate into directory.
<!--
### 3. Try running `./ui.sh -local -debug 2>&1 | grep -v 'Detected anchors on an item that is managed by a layout.'`

But get following error:
```
QQmlApplicationEngine failed to load component
file:///home/sschlinkert/Downloads/cwtch/linux/qml/main.qml:-1 No such file or directory

```

### 3. Ensure you have the latest version of Tor installed. 

Unfortunately, on Ubuntu, `sudo apt install tor` will give you a version of tor that's too old to run Cwtch. Instead, [follow instructions found here](https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en#ubuntu), which I outline below as well. 

a. `sudo apt install apt-transport-https`
b. Add the following lines to `/etc/apt/sources.list`:
```bash
deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org bionic main
deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org bionic main
```
c. Import GPG key
```bash
sudo curl https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --import
sudo gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -
```

d. Install tor and keyring
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
```

### 4. Running Cwtch

To run Cwtch, you need to navigate one directory up and run `./linux/ui.sh`. Cwtch should launch!

I think my handle is `alice~xg4j2xfz2k7zl2apy4nyrye7qesnjrqebgjhu2q544wydfypgyshk3yd` (can't seem to change my handle from "alice" just yet...).
