Via [r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards), the mechanical keyboards subbreddit, I found this interesting interview with Eiiti Wada, the creator of the Happy Hacking Keyboard (which I love and use and have [written about before](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/an-update-to-my-keyboard-game/)). The interview's introduction cites a previous interview with Wada where we apparently gave a quote that I think is just lovely: 

> "Because keyboards are accessories to PC makers, they focus on minimizing the manufacturing costs. But that's incorrect. When America's cowboys were in the middle of a trip and their horse died, they would leave the horse there. But even if they were in the middle of a desert, they would take their saddle with them. The horse was a consumable good, but the saddle was an interface that their bodies had gotten used to. In the same vein, PCs are consumable goods, while keyboards are important interfaces."

Apparently there are ["Saddle" t-shirts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3zga1k/interview_professor_eiiti_wada_creator_of_the_hhkb/cyluhxx).
