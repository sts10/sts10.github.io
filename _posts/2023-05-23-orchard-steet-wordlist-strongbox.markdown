Exciting news! One of my Orchard Street Wordlists in now available to users of the [Strongbox password manager](https://strongboxsafe.com/). 

![Screenshot from iOS App Store showing "What's New" in Version 1.58.14 of Strongbox - Password Manager. The 7th bullet point reads: "Improved Diceware Wordlists and added Orchard Street list (h/t Sam Schlinkert)"](/img/strongbox/changelog.png)

Since Strongbox is [open source](https://github.com/strongbox-password-safe/Strongbox), we can [see the Orchard Street Medium list in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/strongbox-password-safe/Strongbox/blob/master/resources/wordlists/orchard-street-medium.txt).

Hopefully the first of many programs to use my Orchard Street Wordlists, [which are available on GitHub](https://github.com/sts10/orchard-street-wordlists).
