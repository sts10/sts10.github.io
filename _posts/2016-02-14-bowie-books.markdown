On January 11th, the day after David Bowie died, The New York Public Library's blog posted [a list of the musician's 100 favorite books](http://www.nypl.org/blog/2016/01/11/david-bowies-top-100-books?hspace=332034), based off of [a Facebook post on his verified page from 2013](https://www.facebook.com/davidbowie/?target_post=10151603205477665&ref=story_permalink). A friend sent me the NYPL link and I, delighted by the idea of a project, looked up each of them on Amazon.

There are some interesting trends-- as you'd expect there's a few histories of music (which I'm currently uninterested in), but also a handful about Black history and Russian history. I'd read a few of them (big thumbs-up for _Kafka Was the Rage_), and I had recently read other books by Bruce Chatwin and Michael Chabon, but most I'd never heard of.

I ended up ordering 16 (I think) of them, mostly the never-heard-ofs:

- _Mr Norris Changes Trains_
- _Maldoror and the Complete Works of the Comte de Lautr√©amont_
- _The Leopard: A Novel_
- _Nights at the Circus_
- _Interviews with Francis Bacon (Subsequent)_
- _The Quest for Christa T._
- _City of Night_
- _Passing (Penguin Classics)_
- _Money: A Suicide Note (Penguin Ink)_
- _The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea_
- _Zanoni_
- _The Trial of Henry Kissinger_
- _Last Exit to Brooklyn_
- _Infants of the Spring_
- _The 42nd Parallel: Volume One of the U.S.A. Trilogy_
- _Darkness at Noon_

I've now read three of them so far: _Zanoni_ by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, _The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea_ by Yukio Mishima, and most recently _Nights At The Circus_ by Angela Carter. I didn't like _The Sailor_ and I didn't even finished _Zanoni_ ([it's free on Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Zanoni-Edward-Bulwer-Lytton-ebook/dp/B0084A7YGQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1455465835&sr=8-2&keywords=zanoni) by the way), but _Nights at the Circus_ was a real treat. 

There's a lot of color, performance, sadness, and female-ness in _Nights at the Circus_-- "A luscious and gooey dessert of a book... doled out in sinful proportions," heralds _The Washington Post Book World_; "Loud, bawdy, and unabashedly sentimental," wrote someone at the _Times_. I think those both seem pretty apt, especially the "bawdy." 

I don't know much about Bowie, but I also think it's pretty easy to see why this book was one of his favorites.  For each of these books, it's fun to imagine where he read them, how he heard of them, what he took from them.

Now I get to choose which one to try next.
