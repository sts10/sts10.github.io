I've joined [totallynuclear.club](http://totallynuclear.club/), a shared UNIX serve similar to Paul Ford's [tilde club](http://tilde.club/) (read more about [how tilde club got started](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf)). 

On totallynuclear I'm [~schlink](http://totallynuclear.club/~schlink). 

I'm in the process of building a basic blog CMS using Ruby and ERB for these types of sites. I'm calling it [Radiation](https://github.com/sts10/radiation/), and I just pushed out version 0.1.0 (I'm going by a pretty arbitrary version numbering system). 

I might write up a nice long post about my process writing Radiation here, but so far I've being using Radiation itself to blog about my progress. [Here's that blog](http://totallynuclear.club/~schlink).
