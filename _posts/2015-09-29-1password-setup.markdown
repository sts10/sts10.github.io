## Desktop

I first downloaded the desktop app as [a free trial](https://agilebits.com/onepassword). Then enabled sync via Dropbox. Then I downloaded [the Chrome extension](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/extensions) so it could auto-fill everything in Chrome on desktop. 

## iOS/iPhone

Then I downloaded [the iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) on my iPhone, than I followed [these instructions](https://guides.agilebits.com/1password-ios/5/en/topic/enable-extension) to add 1Password functionality to my iOS Safari.

## Previously

Previously I had been using [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) on desktop (no iOS functionality that I'm aware of), but I was a bit too afraid to save my encrypted database to my shared Dropbox folder. Though if I was willing to sacrifice the iOS functionality and the Chrome extension, I'd probably go with the KeePassX + Dropbox solution.
